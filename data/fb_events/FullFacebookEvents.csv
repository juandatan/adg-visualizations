The capoeiristas emphasize on control of their movements, quick strategy and reaction to smoothly trick each other and conquer one anotherâ€™s space.Those who form the roda clap, sing and play hand-made percussive instruments such as the berimbau, the atabaque (drum), the pandeiro (tambourine), and the agogÃ´ (cowbells). Music is essential in capoeira.  The rhythm played by the berimbau determines the type of game that takes place.  The rhythm also sets the pace of the game, movements and characteristics of a given game.Songs are sung in a call and response format or in the form of narratives. Typically songs can tell stories about capoeira figures, anecdotes, tales, life deceptions or victories, humor, etc.  Often the capoeira singer uses songs to comment on the game being played at the moment, thus making the capoeira roda as spontaneous as it can be."

The capoeiristas emphasize on control of their movements, quick strategy and reaction to smoothly trick each other and conquer one anotherâ€™s space.Those who form the roda clap, sing and play hand-made percussive instruments such as the berimbau, the atabaque (drum), the pandeiro (tambourine), and the agogÃ´ (cowbells). Music is essential in capoeira.  The rhythm played by the berimbau determines the type of game that takes place.  The rhythm also sets the pace of the game, movements and characteristics of a given game.Songs are sung in a call and response format or in the form of narratives. Typically songs can tell stories about capoeira figures, anecdotes, tales, life deceptions or victories, humor, etc.  Often the capoeira singer uses songs to comment on the game being played at the moment, thus making the capoeira roda as spontaneous as it can be."

It cannot be changed without our thinking.â€ù -- Albert Einsteinâ€œFor many states that were once great have now become small; and those that were great in my time were small before. Knowing therefore that human prosperity never continues in the same place, I shall mention both alike.â€ù --HerodotusChange is nothing new. Academics and public intellectuals have always struggled with change, examining its nature and effects through the lenses of literature, science, philosophy, theology, sociology, economics, and psychology. These studies have regarded change as a driving force, variously positive and negative, but always present. This conference will explore change as a theme and inspiration of both academic discourse and scientific exploration, from antiquity to the present day and beyond. We invite papers/posters and panel/session proposals from all disciplines focusing on works from any period that explore change as it is discussed in literature, philosophy, theory, art, film, science, or society and its effects on the study of the same. Possible topics falling under this heading include, but are not limited to: Difficulties posed by change; Persistence of identity throughout change; Varieties of change; Conditions of change; Beginning and ending; Change and the individual; Climate and environmental change; Regime change and revolution; Paradigm shifts; Gender; Race; Education; Representation; Love; Death; Scientific change; Evolutionary change; and Societal change.To submit to the conference please go to our website and follow the directions.Individual Paper Abstracts due by January 5"

Many of the programs she studies often operate at the same site, rather than bussing the children in from another location to be with the older adults.â€œThereâ€™s a lot or rich opportunities, not just for families, but also in the broader sense of the community,â€ù said Heyman.She added that in the past there may have been a custom of parents living in the home to take care of grandchildren, but new programming is far larger scope bringing the custom into the community. She added that avoiding duplication of services is also a practical matter.â€œMany retirees find it extremely beneficial to help students with their reading and some of the youth help the adults become computer literate,â€ù she said. â€œBut while there may be savings in cost, more importantly there is the value of enriching lives.â€ù"

Knowing therefore that human prosperity never continues in the same place, I shall mention both alike.â€ù --HerodotusChange is nothing new. Academics and public intellectuals have always struggled with change, examining its nature and effects through the lenses of literature, science, philosophy, theology, sociology, economics, and psychology. These studies have regarded change as a driving force, variously positive and negative, but always present. This conference will explore change as a theme and inspiration of both academic discourse and scientific exploration, from antiquity to the present day and beyond. We invite papers/posters and panel/session proposals from all disciplines focusing on works from any period that explore change as it is discussed in literature, philosophy, theory, art, film, science, or society and its effects on the study of the same. Possible topics falling under this heading include, but are not limited to: Difficulties posed by change; Persistence of identity throughout change; Varieties of change; Conditions of change; Beginning and ending; Change and the individual; Climate and environmental change; Regime change and revolution; Paradigm shifts; Gender; Race; Education; Representation; Love; Death; Scientific change; Evolutionary change; and Societal change.To submit to the conference please go to our website and follow the directions.Individual Paper Abstracts due by January 5"

To register email ajomcmahon@fordham.edu or call 914-367-3364.In a collaborative effort, Children FIRST will join the Ravazzin Center on Aging for a conference that merges the groupsâ€™ two separate missions: one that focuses on the helping the aging, and the other which focuses on helping the young.The event, titled â€œPractice Across the Lifespan: Intergenerational Work in Action,â€ù will take place on Wed., March 9, at Fordhamâ€™s Westchester campus from 11:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. National policy and best practices will be discussed in lectures an breakout sessions.â€œWe often silo child welfare and care for the aging,â€ù said Janna Heyman, PhD, professor and director of the Ravazzin Center. â€œWhat weâ€™re trying to foster is a way to blend the services.â€ùHeyman said that several studies have shown that it is mutually beneficial for children and older adults to work together on crafts, story times, dance, and play. Many of the programs she studies often operate at the same site, rather than bussing the children in from another location to be with the older adults.â€œThereâ€™s a lot or rich opportunities, not just for families, but also in the broader sense of the community,â€ù said Heyman.She added that in the past there may have been a custom of parents living in the home to take care of grandchildren, but new programming is far larger scope bringing the custom into the community. She added that avoiding duplication of services is also a practical matter.â€œMany retirees find it extremely beneficial to help students with their reading and some of the youth help the adults become computer literate,â€ù she said. â€œBut while there may be savings in cost, more importantly there is the value of enriching lives.â€ù"

The three-stage CrossFit Games season acts as a funnel, starting with the all-inclusive online Open, advancing to the selective live regionals, and concluding with an elite few on a world stage at the CrossFit Games.The 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games East Regional features the fittest men, women, and teams from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. 41,000 athletes from these two regions entered the Open, but only the top-40 men, 40 women, and 30 6-person teams were invited to compete at the East Regional (May 27-29).Over the course of the three-day weekend, the athletes will face a barrage of tests designed to reveal any flaws in their fitness. Can they do well in long events? Short events? Heavy lifting? Gymnastics? To make it to the Games, these athletes must be true generalists capable of handling any task thrown at them.The five men, five women, and five teams who do the best in relation to their peers across all of the events will be invited to compete at the CrossFit Games held at the StubHub Center in Carson, California July 19-24.The East Regional will be held at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.Regional tickets cost $75 for three days of access, or $30 per day.Kids 12 and under are admitted free of charge with a ticketed adult.Each affiliate owner (Licensee of Record) will receive a complimentary three-day ticket to their local regional. These complimentary tickets will be available via will call and are transferrable. Learn more at games.crossfit.com"

Hunts Point and Mott Haven,The Bronx,1.68372E+15,The Open,SPORTS_EVENT,2016-02-25T17:00:00-0800,"Registration for the Open begins Jan. 14, 2016.More than 272,000 people from around the globe competed in the Open last year. As the largest CrossFit community event of the season, the Open ties together athletes from within the same gym to those in their broader city, country and world.For five weeks, youâ€”and the hundreds of thousands of other people who signed upâ€”are at the whim of the Director of the Games Dave Castro, taking on workouts that may push you to learn a new skill, improve the skills you already have or go into a darker place than youâ€™ve ever been before.The Open welcomes anyone 14 to 100 years old. (Weâ€™ll take any centenarians, too.) All you need to do is sign up, and enter a score each week. You can complete the workouts at a participating CrossFit affiliate in front of a judge, or film your performance from anywhere you want and submit a link as proof.To make the Open even more accessible, we introduced a scaled option in 2015. Each time a workout is released, athletes will be given two versions: Rxâ€™d and Scaled. The Scaled-workout option is designed to be accessible to the majority of people who attend CrossFit affiliates. If you do CrossFit, thereâ€™s a very high chance you can do the Open, too.Workouts are released each week on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, and athletes have four days or 96 hours to complete the workout and submit their score. Scores are due before 5 p.m. PT that Monday.Five Weeks | Feb. 25 - March 28, 201616.1: Feb. 25 - 2916.2: March 3 - 716.3: March 10 - 1416.4 March 17 - 2116.5 March 24 - 28The fittest athletes will advance to the next stage of the season.More: http://games.crossfit.com/about-the-games/the-open"

Can they do well in long events? Short events? Heavy lifting? Gymnastics? To make it to the Games, these athletes must be true generalists capable of handling any task thrown at them.The five men, five women, and five teams who do the best in relation to their peers across all of the events will be invited to compete at the CrossFit Games held at the StubHub Center in Carson, California July 19-24.The East Regional will be held at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.Regional tickets cost $75 for three days of access, or $30 per day.Kids 12 and under are admitted free of charge with a ticketed adult.Each affiliate owner (Licensee of Record) will receive a complimentary three-day ticket to their local regional.

As the largest CrossFit community event of the season, the Open ties together athletes from within the same gym to those in their broader city, country and world.For five weeks, youâ€”and the hundreds of thousands of other people who signed upâ€”are at the whim of the Director of the Games Dave Castro, taking on workouts that may push you to learn a new skill, improve the skills you already have or go into a darker place than youâ€™ve ever been before.The Open welcomes anyone 14 to 100 years old. (Weâ€™ll take any centenarians, too.) All you need to do is sign up, and enter a score each week. You can complete the workouts at a participating CrossFit affiliate in front of a judge, or film your performance from anywhere you want and submit a link as proof.To make the Open even more accessible, we introduced a scaled option in 2015. Each time a workout is released, athletes will be given two versions: Rxâ€™d and Scaled. The Scaled-workout option is designed to be accessible to the majority of people who attend CrossFit affiliates. If you do CrossFit, thereâ€™s a very high chance you can do the Open, too.Workouts are released each week on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, and athletes have four days or 96 hours to complete the workout and submit their score. Scores are due before 5 p.m. PT that Monday.Five Weeks | Feb. 25 - March 28, 201616.1: Feb. 25 - 2916.2: March 3 - 716.3: March 10 - 1416.4 March 17 - 2116.5 March 24 - 28The fittest athletes will advance to the next stage of the season.More: http://games.crossfit.com/about-the-games/the-open"

If anyone knows me they would know  that I am no Democrat!! But When Domenic Says he is going to do something he follows through and does not stop until the job is done. If I didn't know Domenic the way I do I would probably be voting for Michael Grimm too. While he was Councilman he did these events in the restaurant called THE SENIOR PROMS- He invited all the Senior Citizen in the Synagogues, Churches & Nursing Homes in his district and hired a live Band so the elderly could have a night out. THEY LOVED IT!!! and When we were hit by Hurricane Sandy Domenic used whatever contacts he had to get the Red Cross and Fema set up in MCU parking lot within two days. He begged me to open Gargiulos Restaurant  so we could arrange feeding the people of Coney Island Thanksgiving Dinner, When it was impossible for me to accommodate it. He hired buses to transport the people to and From the El Caribe. I feel the reason he is having a difficult time is because he cares more about the people and less about the politicians.I can honestly Support Domenic and I know that if he wins He will get the right people in place to get the job done. and we will truly have a partner in Government to bring the resource that we so desperately need.                   VOTE FOR Domenic Recchia"

Simply put, this Graffiti is calligraphic. This Street Art is primarily image based,  or when textual, conceptual. Of course, people have written and drawn on walls ever since the walls were caves, rocks, clay, or just dirt. This exhibit,  concerns popular contemporary urban formats. Inspired by the attention that the calligraphically oriented classic graffiti writers-who adopted self appointed monikers as did the hip hop musicians of the day, a later generation of artists took to the streets in order to take advantage of the exposure the writers had experienced. This show is not a comprehensive overview but a selection of graffiti writers who rose to prominence during its â€œgolden eraâ€ù of the 1970s, and the most prolific street artists who subsequently developed the form from the mid/late â€˜70s through the early 1980s. Graffiti vs Street Art: A History, features significant artist from both sides of the coin.  Al Diaz(Bomb One, Samo*) co-curator, selected the following graffiti writers to participate; Samo*, Bomb One, Snake -1, Flint, Jester, Tracy 168, & Lee. The following street artist were selected by co-curator Christopher Hart Chambers(avant*); avant*, Scot Borofsky, Linus Coraggio, Richard Hambleton, Ken Hiratsuka, RV, Dan Witz, & Keith Haring.*Samo was a duo including Al Diaz and Jean-Michelle Basquiat**avant was a group of as many as twelve individual artists.

So whether you are looking to get in better shape, or redirecting a positive flow of energy within your body, I am excited to practice with you. This will be a donation based event. However, half the proceeds will be going to my friends from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, so feel free to be generous if you can.Open to all amounts of yoga asana (posture) experience.

Meet the artist tonight!,ART_EVENT,2016-10-04T20:00:00-0400,"â€œOne splendid artist, Anton Petrov, loves walking the streets of St. Petersburg always in search of the absolute; letting himself to soak into the atmosphere of many colors, shapesand dynamics of ever changing cityâ€ùâ€_ Being just a little child, Anton would express a great interest to the fine art. The inception of that enthusiasm still noted in some of his recent works: the way he conveyed his vision - beautiful strokes of expressionism are mesmerizingindeed! Especially it is well distinctive in his painting â€œPortugalâ€™s portâ€œ and â€œThe Dreamâ€ù.After Antonâ€™s realization that the Art is his true call, he went to the Russian Academy of Arts in one of the most sophisticated cities â€“ St. Petersburg. As any artist, he has a unique way of sharing his thoughts with the world on the canvas. Some of hislife statements certainly have influenced it: â€œInspiration is a very elusive phenomenon, you simply have to love the feel of the brush in your hand to keep creatingâ€ù and â€œFearless process of daydreaming and workâ€_â€ù- that is where we find Realism theme in his works, such as â€œA girl with applesâ€ù, â€œThe Huntersâ€ù.During his years in Academy Anton has always been very vigorous and diligent. He participated in over a 10 big art competitions that brought him an awards and certain fame. Because of such hard work and talent, part of the artistâ€™s paintings were succefully sold to some private house collections in Russia.As it is appropriate for any artistic spirit, Anton followed his art-fervor to NYC to explore a new horizon, culture and trends. â€œOne splendid artist is now walking the streets of Manhattanâ€_â€ù"

Potential is a record steeped in histories â€“ of its characters, of its forebears â€“ but is startlingly new and alive: the network may be ones and zeros but the circuitry here runs on blood, still.James Hinton made the computer his primary instrument after falling under the spell of Baltimore club, bringing in his broader sonic influences from early â€˜90s jungle, early â€˜00s grime and mid â€˜00s electronica to a new sonic whole. The software was the thing at home, but what excited the young producer was the network, and where he spiraled was YouTube. Potential uses as its backbone a series of vocal samples that Hinton has found in the forgotten corners of the site, guiding us around the hinterlands of YouTube, introducing us to unknown artists expressing themselves unfettered by the constraints of industry, lost in the infinite potential of an audience unknown.He will be joined by Jim-E Stack. Jim-E Stack has always had a knack taking a wild and assorted set of influences and filtering them into a coherent, heartfelt sound. Currently based out of New York, Jim-E Stack perfected his own sound one that synthesizes everything from 90s house to Baltimore club. Initially, Jim-E Stack has built a following on the strength of his early singles and EPs on labels like Body High and Good Years and his remixes for the likes of Sky Ferreira and A$AP Rocky. This year he released two singles, 'Dreamt' and 'Deadstream' as well as a cover of BjÃ¶rk's 'Hyperballad' featuring Lower Dens singer Jana Hunter.Listenhttps://soundcloud.com/therangemusichttps://soundcloud.com/jimestack"

Although the single is the first work to be released from Chairlift in three years, the duo â€“ comprised of writer/producers and multi-instrumentalists Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly â€“ has hardly been quiet. They collaborated with BeyoncÃ© on her groundbreaking self-titled album via the track â€œNo Angel,â€ù which was written and produced by Caroline and co-produced by Patrick. Caroline released and toured Arcadia, a self-produced solo album under the alias Ramona Lisa and collaborated with SBTRKT, Blood Orange and others, while Patrick produced and collaborated with artists such as Solange Knowles, Wet, Kelela, and Tei Shi.An evolution from their last album, 2012â€™s Something, Moth proves to be an emotionally uninhibited and markedly stronger, more pop inspired body of work. A very New York City inspired album, listeners can expect to be led through an aural mix of big, rich pop inspired hooks, vibrating bass, lively brass and sensuous R&B inspired vocals, all anchored in the duoâ€™s meticulously crafted instrumentation.Mr Twin Sister""Twin Sister are a Brooklyn-by-way-of-Long Island quintet that do so much so well. Their songs have a remarkable sense of atmosphere and romanticism. They nod at their heroes-- maybe Stereolab and Bjork, maybe Cocteau Twins or 1980s pop-- without overtly stealing. They seem to know they are capable of great things..."" - PitchforkThe band's self-titled album is the second full length album by the five members of Twin Sister, now known as Mr Twin Sister. Following their debut LP, composed largely in a studio, the band returned to the creative process they had employed on their first two EPs- working individually or in small, shifting groups. Ideas germinated in an environment where experimentation was encouraged. Some bloomed immediately, others matured slowly over the years, the rest demolished and rebuilt dozens of times in an effort to discover their ideal form. Progress was slow, coming in fits and bursts, accommodating the unexpected twists and turns of life.JunglepussyBrooklyn rapper Junglepussy, known for her fiery lyrics that pack a punch and her unapologetic attitude, first started making music at the end of 2012. Since then sheâ€™s released two projects, Satisfaction Guaranteed and Pregnant with Success, given talks at Yale, Columbia, and NYU, licensed her music for Comedy Centralâ€™s Broad City, and walked in the DKNY fashion show. She's been cosigned by everyone from Diddy and Erykah Badu to Action Bronson and Le1f, and played shows with Lil Kim, Nelly Furtato, Travis Scott, Solange, and Dev Hynes. â€œJunglepussy means business, and sheâ€™s got the talent to back it up. With a raw sexuality and a strong message about female autonomy and empowerment, sheâ€™s a modern Lil Kim.â€ù"

Metro Area brings back the soulful experimentation of the early club classics, mixing live and electronic instruments.  Simultaneously, the mood and minimalism of more recent forms creep into the mix: Detroit's cold futurism, Chicago's abstract track-modes, the warmth of New York and New Jersey's deep house and the experimentation of brave pop music.  All of these influences combine with the duoâ€™s unique perspective to create a distinctive sound that is unmistakably their own.BENOIT & SERGIOBenoit & Sergio produce dance songs that sometimes seem like musical open letters; editorials narrated in the voices of unidentified, yet totally recognizable colorful characters, read aloud against a backdrop of beautifully lush, warm and sensuous electronic pop music. The French/US duo met at an after party in Berlin, and it wasnâ€™t long before their signature combination of rich synth work combined with pop influenced lyrical magic and impressive songwriting had been released on labels such as Spectral Sound, DFA, Visionquest, Hot Creations and Culprit.JUSTIN MILLERJustin Miller is a quintessential New York City DJ. Mixing the classically cool with the always-cool and the brand new, heâ€™s a selector whose tastes spread across best of techno, deep house, and disco new and old. Part of that diversity likely comes from his tenure as DFA Records assistant label manager and sole employee for seven years, guiding the seminal NYC label through one of its most fruitful periods. After leaving DFA he started Have A Killer Time Recordings and is now the head of Deus Records.THE ALMOND BROTHERSAn accident turned happy when their nut roasting carts convened outside the fabled Mangiami many moons ago.  Three long lost brothers decided to team up and take their veritable idiot circus around the world for schnitz and wiggles.  Put on your party hats because it's never a dull moment when these nuts drop the jams."

The time is right, the tracks are right, and Ryan Elliott is exactly where he needs to be. Elliott, whose distinction as an internationally respected DJ, remixer, and one-half of Spectral Soundâ€™s A&R team, has grown steadily over his decade-plus behind the decks. They donâ€™t hand out â€œDJâ€™s DJâ€ù reputations at the club door, and Elliottâ€™s is well-earned and well-deserved. Influenced by his hometown staples (Axis, Purpose Maker, M Plant, and UR) along with international labels like Perlon, Playhouse, and early Kompakt, Ryan inhabits his kick drums, becoming an extension of the music and vice versa.MIGUEL SENQUIZDetroit native Miguel Senquiz has artfully crafted a unique voice from a rich musical background. With roots firmly established in the gravitas of the areaâ€™s heritage, heâ€™s incorporated a unique soulful texture and a polished-but-scuffed aesthetic aided in part by his connection to the Ghostly family. Growing up and seeing legends like Richie Hawtin, Delano Smih and Derrick Carter, Heâ€™s used that experience and knowledge to hone in on his own sound, gaining a reputation for long and energetic sets threading, and sometimes blurring the lines of house, techno, and acid.PARRISH SMITHParrish Smith crafts a sound thatâ€™s both familiar and deeply inexplicable. Hovering between body music, electronica and deep-burning jakbeat yet rejecting the conventions of all three, his output is as elusive as it is absorbing. Inspired by personal experiences and his determination to keep evolving, Smith developed a distinctive sound derived from an all-analogue set-up, sampling every object that produces sound.Tickets $10 advanced or $15 at the doorDoors 10pm / +21 gigListenhttps://soundcloud.com/ryan-elliotthttps://soundcloud.com/htmiguelhttps://soundcloud.com/parrishsmith"

The Norwegian space-disco wizardâ€™s new EP, Windings, is three tracks of that now-classic sound closely associated with LindstrÃ¸mâ€™s name: skyward synths, effervescent rhythms, and melodies that spiral beautifully into the great unknown. This is LindstrÃ¸m in the zoneâ€”and if youâ€™ve been paying close attention over the last decade, itâ€™s a zone heâ€™s never left.Recorded over the past year, Windings represents LindstrÃ¸mâ€™s latest crystallization of the aesthetic that the greater world was introduced to on the 2006 compilation Itâ€™s a Feedelity Affair, as well as the tangy pop of 2012â€™s masterful Smalhans. This isnâ€™t to say LindstrÃ¸mâ€™s repeating himselfâ€”far from it, in fact. Windings finds our arpeggiator-obsessed hero refining an aesthetic that already sounded perfectâ€”a zenith that, much like the music itself, hits new peaks even when it seems that thereâ€™s no more ceiling to breach.JoakimSince his beginnings in 1999, Joakim has taken great efforts to avoid being pigeonholed and has grown on the outskirts of the French Touch and international Club scenes, becoming one of their major players and an ever surprising outsider. Year after year, Joakim has gathered experiences that confirm his global vision of music and explored many facets of the musical spectrum: a musician with five albums under his belt; a label founder and manager (the fantastic Tigersushi and the recent vinyl-only Crowdspacer imprint)From FantoÌ‚mes in 2003, deviating house music from the end of the 90â€™s, to Nothing Gold in 2011, a vision of pop music as defined by the DFA label, and the more cerebral, frosty and metallic Monsters & Silly Songs in 2006, Joakim has left his fingerprints on current electro, modernizing and hybridizing it, with no concern for schools and genres, taking his inspiration from new wave as well as krautrock, noise and disco, soul and pop, ambient and house.Barbie BertischBorn & raised in Buenos Aires, Brooklyn resident Barbie Bertisch emerged with a passion for genre-bending dance music. Her ever-growing record collection ranges from ambient, fusion & crossover jazz, latin grooves with a flair for afrobeat, cosmic, left-field, house and soulful disco delight. She is also a frequent collaborator on dance music zine Love Injection, co-hosts its monthly namesake radio show on Dublab, has a weekly show on The Lot Radio, and is part of NYC's Classic Album Sundays family.NaduveNaduve is the already told story of an Indie rock Accordion player turned on acid into an Analog Synth pornographer. After a boot camp as the resident DJ at the late MICHATRONIX nano club and DJing as a regular at Tel Avivâ€™s clubs like The Block, Bootleg, Breakfast Club and many more, he is about to release his new works on labels like Cocktail Dâ€™amore and Disco Halal. Apart from that nonsense he also takes place in the 84%Creativity (of Malka Tuti label) collective who took the mission of bringing joy the darkest corners of Tel Aviv and His live project - (Shame On Us) along with Yovav Arzi and Alek Lee.Tickets $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the doorDoors - 10pm / +21 gigListen - https://soundcloud.com/feedelityhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimbouazizhttps://www.mixcloud.com/barbie-bertisch/https://soundcloud.com/naduve"

This night brings a long overdue debut from Detroit, making their first appearance in New York City with a much heralded Live PA, we are delighted to host Aux88.  Their history spans from the present back to the mid 80s when Tommy Hamilton was working with Juan Atkins on various projects with the seminal Metroplex imprint, 430 West, and with Keith Tucker, their own Puzzlebox Records. In the mid 90s, following forays into solo projects, Aux88 reformed to the present day incarnation.  Their bass heavy electro is a definitively Detroit sound.  In recent years the duo has made several key appearances at international festivals including Dekmantel, Movement, and Awakenings.  Their performance is not to be missed. Chicago native Justin Long adds his talents to the bill with an all vinyl set.  Smart Bar Chicago's senior resident hosts one of the city's most heralded underground events, Hugo Ball, which champions exclusively all vinyl sets and caters to the dancefloor, not the Internet.  As a producer, Long has recently embarked on his collaborative project on Brooklyn Imprint LIES, Circling Vultures with Ken Zawacki that debuted earlier this year. As one of the most dynamic and creative Djs from the Windy City, we are honored to have him for this event. TrÃ_ SkÃ_l founder  Kimyon rounds out the lineup in the Good Room. He has been busy in the studio with recent releases on Metroplex and a remix on Crosstown Rebels, both appearing this year.  His imprint No Agenda releases its first EP before the end of the year, a 12 inch featuring local siren Bridgit Barkan.  The Bad Room hosts Lauren Flax, the Detroit native and Brooklyn transplant, who is celebrating her upcoming release on Nervous Records.  Local hero Turtle Bugg rounds out the talent for the night."

His influence runs deep, through both adopted hometown of Detroit, and music culture as a whole: as one of the Belleville Three, the high school trio which also includes Juan Atkins and Derrick May, he irreparably changed the face of electronic music; with Inner City, he gave it some of its most memorable tunes.His nickname of â€˜The Elevatorâ€™ is apt: for his role in transporting Detroitâ€™s new sound to a wider audience; as anyone who has seen him perform live can attest, his high-energy, high-spirit and high-impact DJ sets; and for spending the past 35 years of his life progressing the culture he helped create. Operating in tandem to his golden run as a producer in the late 80s and early 90s, Saundersonâ€™s own KMS record label â€“ a remarkable 30 years strong in 2017 â€“ has chronicled the early footsteps of R-Tyme, Blake Baxter, MK, Chez Damier, Derrick Carter, Bicep and even Saundersonâ€™s son and regular DJ partner Dantiez more recently.CONTAKTInitially introduced to techno and house by witnessing awe inspiring sets from Detroit hometown heroes such as BMG, Mike Clark, and Robert Hood at illegal parties around Michigan, Contakt has quietly smuggled the Motor Cityâ€™s refusal to stick to just one of those two genres to NYC via his floor-filling DJ sets, co-founding and curating the forward thinking Brooklyn club night TURRBOTAXÂ®, and producing 12â€ùs for labels like Argot, Icee Hot, and Local Action that refuse to be categorized in a single genre. LOVE TEMPOGood Room residents Love Tempo are back in the Bad Room for a night of Balearic, house, acid, cosmic, new wave, disco and whatever else they pull out of their record bags. The night will be helmed by to legends of the scene, Justin Strauss and Billy Caldwell.Justin Strauss has spent more than three decades at the forefront of the NYC dance scene. Starting as DJ at New Yorkâ€™s legendary Mudd Club, he spun his way through The Ritz, Limelight, Area, Tunnel, M.K., Life, Centro Fly and more, pioneering his own distinctive sound, and becoming one of the most sought-after remixers and producers not just in New York, but in the world. Billy Caldwell made his name at Manchester U.Ks legendary HOME , Hacienda & Paradise Factory Clubsâ€™ as well as co founding and DJing at the Infamous 'Epping Walk After Hours' Party in his native Manchester England.Tickets - $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the door +21 gig Listen - https://soundcloud.com/kevinsaunderson"

Since the release of 2015's ""Good Heavens"", which was Monogold's acoustic-based effort, they have torn down any preconceived notions that they or anyone else had of them. After completely stripping down their sound for ""Good Heavens"", the Monogold boys took this new foundation of simplicity and started building with their signature, catchy power-trio melodies and hooks. They still like to go deep on the lush soundscapes, but their songs have become a bit more focused and driven by the instrumentation and the vocals. With their new EP, Kelly, Apuzzo, and Falotico are giving the world a small taste of what is to come in the future of the band. The four song EP is a prelude to another full length record which is in the process of being mixed right now. As with their new found musical simplicity, the lyrical content will tackle the simple things: breastfeeding, giving birth, being born, fucking, bugs, and of course, penises and vaginas meeting for the first time. There's about two albums worth of songs written, and Monogold couldn't bear to keep them to themselves anymore! Chappochappomusic.comStarlight Girlshttp://starlightgirls.net/index.php?page=musicDecember 16th7PM // $10 Upstairs Venue *Show times may varyMinors Under 17 with Parent or Legal Guardian"

This week, we present Mark Normand Live!What can I say about Mark Normand that hasn't already been said about the charming boy next door? Well so far, Mark has done a Comedy Central HALF HOUR special, has appeared on TBSâ€™s CONAN 4 times, Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Showtimeâ€™s â€œLive at SXSWâ€ù, INSIDE AMY SCHUMER, TruTv, Best Week Ever, MTv, Last Comic Standing, @Midnight and released an album with Comedy Central records titled â€œStill Got Itâ€ù (itâ€™s not bad). This year, Mark took first place at the Great American Comedy Festival competition. In 2013 won Carolineâ€™s March Madness competition, beating out 63 other comedians. And this is a real shocker for all of us, but he was also voted Village Voiceâ€™s â€œBest Comedian of 2013â€ù, I know, right? In 2012, Mark appeared on â€œJohn Oliverâ€™s New York Standup Showâ€ù on Comedy Central, and in 2011 was picked as one of Comedy Centralâ€™s â€œComics to Watch.â€ùMark was born and raised in New Orleans, LA surprisingly to two normal parents. As a kid he spent most of his time shooting short films and wetting the bed. He started doing comedy right after college and quickly moved to New York. Mark now does comedy clubs and colleges across the country and has been involved in many festivals including Portland, Seattle, DC, Boston, Vancouver, Melbourne and in 2013 was featured as a New Face at the Montreal Comedy Festival.More annoying accolades that no one really cares about: Mark was named one of Comedy Centralâ€™s Comics To Watch for the 2011 New York Comedy Festival. Mark was also named Esquireâ€™s â€œBest New Comedians 2012â€ù, Splitsiderâ€™s â€œTop 10 Up and Coming Comedians on Each Coastâ€ù, and Time Out New Yorkâ€™s â€œ21 New York Comedy Scene Linchpinsâ€ù. And he regularly opens for Amy Schumer in small venues like Madison Square Garden.He'll be joined by: Brian Theriot, Frank Liotti, Alia Janine and more!This show is FREE but we do ask for a $10 Suggested Donation if possible.

Greenpoint,Brooklyn,1.10437E+15,"The Hollows, Goldenchild, Phil Pickens",MUSIC_EVENT,2016-11-30T20:00:00-0500,"Brooklyn Bazaar PresentsThe Hollows /w GOLDENCHILD & Phil PickensNovember 30th, 20167pm // $10 (Upstairs Venue) The Hollowshttp://www.thehollowsonline.com/https://www.facebook.com/thehollowsTry looking backwards and forwards at the same time. Okay, stop tryingâ€” youâ€™re going to hurt yourself. Let The Hollows do it for you. Theyâ€™re fully aware that theyâ€™re standing on the shoulders of giants, and theyâ€™re blazing a path ahead with the musical equivalent of a flamethrower. These frontiersmen of the New York City roots-rock scene have been creating an old sound that sounds newâ€” or maybe the other way aroundâ€” since 2009.When you first see The Hollows take the stage, you will find them out of place. They will appear to be a ragtag set of traveling performers, accustomed to closing out barn dances and just as likely to steal your prize-winning cow as to wake up next to your sister in a hayloft. It will seem to you that they woke up, one confused morning, to find themselves instead on a Brooklyn street corner.But when the first notes reach your ears, whether from a sweet and breezy mandolin, a whiskey-tuned banjo, or an unrepentant guitar, it will seem to you that the sound of The Hollows is uniquely New York: a contradictory, harmonic melting pot that takes all of its roots, twists them around, and produces something else, something new. This scruffy ensemble of multi-instrumentalists, made up of Justin Aaronson, Jeffrey Kurtze, Daniel Kwiatkowski, Rob Morrison, David Paarlberg, and Erik Saxvik, might just as soon swap glockenspiels, trumpets, and harmonicas as plug in a squawking electric guitar or an airy, spacey synthesizer. The result is a veritable junkyard of instruments and musical personalities, a carnival on wheels, a one-man band in six bodies that owns the stage with all the mobile, rhythmic ease of a seasoned railroad gang.When The Hollows first began performing together, they quickly produced a diverse output of material that attracted a local following through several monthly residencies at Peteâ€™s Candy Store, the intimate, longtime Brooklyn venue that served as a launch pad for acts like Will Oldham, Devendra Banhart, Dirty Projectors, and many more. As word spread, the crowds grew, the venues grew to match, and in 2011, The Hollows captured the attention of audiences and reviewers alike with their debut release, Belong to the Land.  Critics called the album, recorded at The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY, an â€œoutstanding offeringâ€ù made by â€œmaster craftsmen,â€ù â€œbrilliantly executedâ€_ a joy to listen to,â€ù an â€œincredible debut effort,â€ù and simply â€œa monster.â€ù  The bandâ€™s artistic production moved beyond the musical with the release of their first video, â€œPoor Eyes,â€ù in 2012, and the song was later highlighted in the soundtrack to Bob Giraldiâ€™s short film â€œA Poet Long Agoâ€ù in 2013.  (Additional tracks from Belong to the Land also appear in the 2013 feature film Twenty Million People and 2014â€™s Sun Belt Express.)Less than a year later, the band continued its â€œmassive momentumâ€ù with the release of a self-titled EP, tracked at Brooklynâ€™s Grand Street Recording and Galaxy Smith Studios, and featured on Spinner, The Huffington Post, MSN, WCBS FM, and MP3.com. A second music video, â€œAugust,â€ù premiered a few months later.  By now, the band was known for its â€œecstatic live showsâ€ù and the â€œmelodic, fiery hoedownâ€ù they inspired, which prompted the release of a live album, Neverending Show, in 2013: a â€œfresh breath of true musician spritâ€ù that offered a â€œsoulful, powerful and thick soundâ€ù and captured â€œeverything that makes seeing The Hollows live in concert so much fun.â€ùOn June 3rd, The Hollows will release their second full-length album, Between the Water and the Wonder Wheel, tracked at The Bunker in Brooklyn with producer John Siket [Sonic Youth, Phish, Yo La Tengo, Dave Matthews Band], engineered by James Frazee [Beck, Patti Smith, Esperanza Spalding], and mastered by Fred Kevorkian [Willie Nelson, Ryan Adams, The White Stripes].  It kicks off with â€œMountains to the Sea,â€ù an anthemic blend of folk and raw electricity that catapults the listener into the rest of the album, which is at times thoughtful and meditative; others rollicking and boisterous.  â€œJamestown,â€ù with its soaring classic rock sensibility, hits hard.  â€œHumpback Heartâ€ù will make you want to drive a pickup across the country, only to get out and dance on the side of the road.  â€œCross Country Callâ€ù and â€œMidnight Bandâ€ù seem to channel ghosts.   â€œThe Ballad of Jack and Viâ€ù is a love song with a range and ambition that could only come from The Hollows, with a crooked cast of characters and a sonic atmosphere that whisks you through the rivers and backwoods of Americana.  The final track, â€œPioneers,â€ù rises slowly from the earth and burns up into the night sky, the ashes fading like a daybreak dream.This summer, The Hollows will hit the ground running with their first national tour, with 30 shows announced in 20 states, and more on the way. When you catch them in action, youâ€™ll see an unpredictable barn-burner full of high-octane foot-stomping and exuberant odes to love on the rocks, life on the lam, death on the road, and the fact that thereâ€™s still a place in music where fallen angels, risen devils, and even the seediest of back bar characters can all live together in six-part harmony.  Youâ€™ll dive into the flood and awake drenched the next morning, with a fire in your belly and a song in your headâ€” surprised to find you had a hootenanny hidden in your toes.GOLDENCHILDhttp://www.goldenchildband.com/https://www.facebook.com/goldenchildbandBrooklyn-based, Florida-born songwriters Wiley Gaby & Jeffrey Doker set out to carve a space where their seemingly disparate influences could meet, mingle, and ultimately blur genre lines to create beautiful new music. Influenced by classic country storytelling, melancholy pop melodies, and pretty things, the duo formed Goldenchild in the spring of 2014, and will release their debut album, Bridges, this fall.With a handful of original tunes ready to record, Doker & Gaby tapped rock producer/engineer Mark Ephraim, whose previous credits include work with The New Pornographers, Ed Vallance, & Au Revoir Simone, to name a few. Ephraimâ€™s darker production paired with the songwritersâ€™ country-influenced melodies yielded a haunting, evocative, and more rock-tinged sound.Joined by a stellar roster of guest players such as Parker Kindred (Antony & The Johnsons, Joan As Policewoman, Jeff Buckley) on drums, Jon Rauhouse (Neko Case) & Ed Kurz (Tatter & Rags) on pedal steel, Caleb Lindskoog (The Silver State, Magmana) on electric guitar, and many others, Ephraim and Goldenchildâ€™s core personnelâ€”Gaby, Doker, guitarist Jeff Mensch, vocalist Kerry Flanagan, and multi-instrumentalist James Powerâ€”recorded Bridges throughout north Brooklyn between 2014 and 2015. On their debut album, Goldenchild merges elements of classic country and ambient soundscapes with a respectable hint of pop sensibility. The result is â€œgorgeous, cosmic countryâ€ù that NYCâ€™s Next magazine calls â€œdamn beautiful.â€ùPhil Pickenshttp://www.philpickens.com/https://www.facebook.com/philpickensmusic/?fref=tsRecently featured on NPR Music and WFUV: A southern gentleman by way of Manhattan, he'll take you to the moon (or at least take your heart there). As a boy in Georgia, picked up a used guitar at a garage sale and learned to play southpaw from a wise lady named Miss Genie. Grew up and released his solo debut, Sweet Tea Circus, in 2012 and is currently working on a follow-up with producer James Frazee (My Morning Jacket, The Hold Steady, Sharon Van Etten). A folk-rock love-letter where banjos and synths set the mood, bass and drums move the current, and vocals and guitar float just above the surface and up into outerspace. ""Relax.

Greenpoint,Brooklyn,8.82643E+14,Art gallery from Saint Petersburg! Meet the artist tonight!,ART_EVENT,2016-10-04T20:00:00-0400,"â€œOne splendid artist, Anton Petrov, loves walking the streets of St. Petersburg always in search of the absolute; letting himself to soak into the atmosphere of many colors, shapesand dynamics of ever changing cityâ€ùâ€_ Being just a little child, Anton would express a great interest to the fine art. The inception of that enthusiasm still noted in some of his recent works: the way he conveyed his vision - beautiful strokes of expressionism are mesmerizingindeed! Especially it is well distinctive in his painting â€œPortugalâ€™s portâ€œ and â€œThe Dreamâ€ù.After Antonâ€™s realization that the Art is his true call, he went to the Russian Academy of Arts in one of the most sophisticated cities â€“ St. Petersburg. As any artist, he has a unique way of sharing his thoughts with the world on the canvas. Some of hislife statements certainly have influenced it: â€œInspiration is a very elusive phenomenon, you simply have to love the feel of the brush in your hand to keep creatingâ€ù and â€œFearless process of daydreaming and workâ€_â€ù- that is where we find Realism theme in his works, such as â€œA girl with applesâ€ù, â€œThe Huntersâ€ù.During his years in Academy Anton has always been very vigorous and diligent. He participated in over a 10 big art competitions that brought him an awards and certain fame. Because of such hard work and talent, part of the artistâ€™s paintings were succefully sold to some private house collections in Russia.As it is appropriate for any artistic spirit, Anton followed his art-fervor to NYC to explore a new horizon, culture and trends. â€œOne splendid artist is now walking the streets of Manhattanâ€_â€ù"

Consent is always freely given and all people in a sexual situation must feel that they are able to say ""yes"" or ""no"" or stop the sexual activity at any point.Consent can be defined  as ""a clear and unambiguous agreement, expressed outwardly through mutually understandable words or actions, to engage in a particular activity."" Consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point. Consent must be voluntarily given and may not be valid if a person is being subjected to actions or behaviors that elicit emotional, psychological, physcial, reputational, financial pressure, threat, intimidation, or fear (coercion or force). Consent to engage in one sexual activity, or past agreement to engage in a particular sexual activity, cannot be presumed to constitute consent to engage in a different sexual activity or to engage again in a sexual activity. Consent cannot be validly given by a person who is incapacitated. At the heart of consent is the idea that every person has a right to personal sovereignty â€“ the right to not be acted upon by someone else in a sexual manner unless they give that person clear permission.  It is the responsibility of the person initiating the sexual activity to get this permission. Consent should not be assumed.Respect other patrons personal space."

The book revolves around three arduous journeys he launched from his home base in Portland, Oregon, between 1969 and 1975.  The stories unfold against the familiar background of communes and collectives, Woodstock and Watergate, sex, dope, acid, rockâ€™nâ€™roll, and the end of civilization as we know it, but at heart this is not a history of those all too-well-chronicled times; itâ€™s a mythic private story of which we all have some idiosyncratic version of our own: the passage from wonderstruck childhood through tortured adulthood to contemplative old age."

Bushwick and Williamsburg,Brooklyn,8.19858E+14,Sweet Science turns 2,NIGHTLIFE,2015-04-30T18:00:00-0400,"Sweet Science is about to celebrate our two year anniversary...it's been a hell of a ride and what else can I say other than THANK YOU.Thank you to all of my family, friends, locals and regulars who've become like family to myself and all the staff at Sweet Science. Thanks for helping a dream become a success, for making every day a celebration, for making Sweet Science grow bigger and bigger.Join us on THURSDAY APRIL 30TH for our two year anniversary party from 6pm til late. We have sponsors PBR and Reyka Vodka in the house helping us kick stat the party, our Head Chef Milton cooking up some tasty appetizers and a new artist launching his newest work at Sweet Science. Amar Stewart recreates history through oil paintings inspired by The Dutch Masters such as Frans Hals, Rembrandt, and Van Dyke and forges a powerful and appealing dichotomy between 17th centuryâ€™s European elite to paragon musicians and superstars of our time. They connect to create a classical take on royalty in the 21st century. His world is a transcendence of time in an ethereal method asking questions of what is considered royalty today."

Consent is always freely given and all people in a sexual situation must feel that they are able to say ""yes"" or ""no"" or stop the sexual activity at any point.Consent can be defined  as ""a clear and unambiguous agreement, expressed outwardly through mutually understandable words or actions, to engage in a particular activity."" Consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point. Consent must be voluntarily given and may not be valid if a person is being subjected to actions or behaviors that elicit emotional, psychological, physcial, reputational, financial pressure, threat, intimidation, or fear (coercion or force). Consent to engage in one sexual activity, or past agreement to engage in a particular sexual activity, cannot be presumed to constitute consent to engage in a different sexual activity or to engage again in a sexual activity. Consent cannot be validly given by a person who is incapacitated. At the heart of consent is the idea that every person has a right to personal sovereignty â€“ the right to not be acted upon by someone else in a sexual manner unless they give that person clear permission.  It is the responsibility of the person initiating the sexual activity to get this permission. Consent should not be assumed.Respect other patrons personal space."

Composed of 14 members, the band appeared first in the late 1990s. They soon became famous for their vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons they were avoided by most radio stations at first. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made their way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the prohibited words), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. Over the years popularity grew tremendously and after many TV and Film features, countless concerts and festival appearances all over the world, Leningrad is now one of the most renowned and legendary Russian bands attracting stadium-size crowds."""

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

Duncanson - http://cash-money-cartoons.tumblr.com/Show: 8PMScreaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

Landrieu was first elected to the Louisiana state legislature at the age of 23. In 1996 she became the first woman from Louisiana elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Senator Landrieu has been the leading voice in Washington for the Gulf Coast recovery effort. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the failures of the federal levee system, she secured billions in recovery dollars and has worked extensively to jumpstart recovery projects.

Chelsea and Clinton,Manhattan,1.7604E+15,Donald Judd Writings,BOOK_EVENT,2016-11-15T19:00:00-0500,"The panel will examine Donald Juddâ€™s relationship to the written word over the four decades contained in the new publication. The panel will include: Flavin Judd, Curator and Co-President of Judd Foundation, co-editor of Donald Judd Writings, and son of Donald Judd; Roberta Smith, Co-Chief Art Critic of The New York Times; Ann Temkin, Marie-JosÃ©e and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art. Moderated by Michael Govan, CEO and Wallis Annenberg Director of The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.Donald Judd Writings, co-published by Judd Foundation and David Zwirner Books, is the most comprehensive collection of the artist's writings assembled to date. Available in November 2016, this timely publication includes Juddâ€™s best-known essays, as well as little-known texts previously published in limited editions. Moreover, this new collection includes unpublished college essays and hundreds of never-before-seen notes, a critical but unknown part of Juddâ€™s writing practice. Juddâ€™s earliest published writing, consisting largely of reviews for hire, defined the terms of art criticism in the 1960s, but his essays as a graduate student at Columbia, published here for the first time, contain the seeds of his later writing, and allow readers to trace the development of his critical style. The writings that followed Juddâ€™s early reviews are no less significant art-historically, but have been relegated to smaller publications and have remained largely unavailable until now. The largest addition of newly available material is a collection of Juddâ€™s unpublished notesâ€”transcribed from his handwritten accounts of and reactions to subjects ranging from the politics of his time to the literary texts he admired most. In these intimate reflections we see Juddâ€™s thinking at his least mediatedâ€”a mind continuing to grapple with questions of its moment, thinking them through, changing positions, and demonstrating the intensity of thought that continues to make Judd such a formidable presence in contemporary art."

The exhibition, which includes a newly commissioned series of works in an immersive installation across media, continues the artistâ€™s engagement with materials as a means of exploring wider conceptual dialogues surrounding structures of production within a specific geographic context. A core aspect of the show is the artistâ€™s collaboration with a community of skilled workers in Sheki, a historic town in Northern Azerbaijan, which was an important post on the ancient Silk Route. Most of the elements in the exhibition were sourced from Sheki Silk Factory, which today operates at a fraction of its Soviet period scale, when it used to employ around 7000 workers. Murillo collaborated with local artisans to create a series of large-scale works based on a medieval stained glass technique still practiced in the region and found in Shekiâ€™s famous Khanâ€™s Palace. The artist replaces the delicate material of glass with scraps of discarded metal from the factory yard, thereby playing with the original aesthetic and adding a political dimension to the poetic oriental design. Murillo frequently explores issues of community and migration drawing upon his own cultural heritage and that of others. Through a meaningful collaboration with the Sheki silk factory and the townâ€™s community, these discourses manifest themselves through both the materials he chooses to use and a revival of the factory as a site of production. This exhibition is curated by Suad Garayeva-Maleki*Special thanks to Tunc LLC and Sheki Ipek JSC.Exhibition opening day: 11 November 2016 at 7 pm  Location: YARAT Contemporary Art Centre (National Flag Square, Bayil, AZ1003)Dates: 11 November â€“ 29 January 2017 Exhibition open: Tuesday through Sunday, from 11:00 until 20:00. Admission is free For more information about YARAT: www.yarat.azFor media and image enquiries please contact:  Hokuma Karimova Telephone: +99 450 2746747 Email: hokuma.k@yarat.az***___¡___ê_  _œ_£_ _˜_›_¬__DIS PLACE ___µ__Ñ‚Ñ€ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT, _‘_°_ºÑƒ, _ê_·_µÑ€_±_°___´_¶_°___ŸÑ€__ÑÅÑ‚Ñ€_°__ÑÅÑ‚____ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT _¿Ñ€_µ_´ÑÅÑ‚_°___»Ñè_µÑ‚ ___°ÑÅÑˆÑ‚_°_±__ÑƒÑ_ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___ºÑƒ _º___»Ñƒ___±_¸__ÑÅ_º______ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_° __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€_° _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__. _ù_° __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_µ  _±Ñƒ_´_µÑ‚ _¿Ñ€_µ_´ÑÅÑ‚_°___»_µ___° _°_±ÑÅ___»Ñ_Ñ‚____ _______°Ñè _°Ñ‚____ÑÅÑ„_µÑ€___°Ñè _¸__ÑÅÑ‚_°_»_»ÑèÑ†_¸Ñè, ÑÅ___·_´_°Ñ_Ñ‰_°Ñè ÑçÑ„Ñ„_µ_ºÑ‚ _¿Ñ€_¸ÑÅÑƒÑ‚ÑÅÑ‚___¸Ñè, _±_»_°_____´_°Ñ€Ñè ÑÅ__Ñ‡_µÑ‚_°___¸Ñ_ Ñ€_°_·_»_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ‚_µÑ…___¸_º. _¡_µÑ€_¸Ñè _¿Ñ€___´___»_¶_°_µÑ‚ _¿___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚_º_¸ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_°  Ñ‡_µÑ€_µ_· Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚Ñƒ ÑÅ Ñ€_°_·_»_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹___¸ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»_°___¸ _¸ÑÅÑÅ_»_µ_´_____°Ñ‚ÑŒ  _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ __Ñ‚____Ñˆ_µ___¸Ñè __ ÑÅ_¿_µÑ†_¸Ñ„_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º____ ___µ____Ñ€_°Ñ„_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º____ _º____Ñ‚_µ_ºÑÅÑ‚_µ.__ÑÅ________Ñ‹__ Ñç_»_µ___µ__Ñ‚____ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸ ÑÅÑ‚_°_»_° _º___»_»_°_±__Ñ€_°Ñ†_¸Ñè Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_° ÑÅ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚___¸_º_°___¸ Ñˆ_µ_»_º__-_¿Ñ€Ñè_´_¸_»ÑŒ______ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸ __ _¨_µ_º_¸, ___´______ _¸_· ÑÅÑ‚_°Ñ€_µ__Ñˆ_¸Ñ… ____Ñ€___´____ ___° ÑÅ_µ___µÑ€_µ _ê_·_µÑ€_±_°___´_¶_°___°. __Ñ‚__Ñ‚ ____Ñ€___´, Ñ€_°ÑÅ_¿___»___¶_µ____Ñ‹__ Ñƒ _¿___´_____¶_¸Ñè ___°___º_°_·ÑÅ_º_¸Ñ… ____Ñ€, _±Ñ‹_» _º_____´_°-Ñ‚__  ___´___¸__ _¸_· Ñ„__Ñ€_¿__ÑÅÑ‚____  _’_µ_»_¸_º______ _¨_µ_»_º__________ _ŸÑƒÑ‚_¸. _‘___»ÑŒÑˆ_°Ñè Ñ‡_°ÑÅÑ‚ÑŒ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»____, _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°____Ñ‹Ñ… _´_»Ñè ÑÅ___·_´_°___¸Ñè __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°____Ñ‡__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚, _±Ñ‹_»_° _¿Ñ€_µ_´__ÑÅÑ‚_°___»_µ___° _¸___µ______ _¨_µ_º_¸__ÑÅ_º____ Ñˆ_µ_»_º___¿Ñ€Ñè_´_¸_»ÑŒ______ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º____, _º__Ñ‚__Ñ€_°Ñè __ _¡_____µÑ‚ÑÅ_º___µ __Ñ€_µ__Ñè ___±_µÑÅ_¿_µÑ‡_¸___°_»_° Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚____ 7000 ÑÅ__Ñ‚Ñ€Ñƒ_´___¸_º____. _¡_µ_____´__Ñè _¶_µ _µ_µ _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ ____Ñ‰____ÑÅÑ‚_¸ _·_°_´_µ__ÑÅÑ‚_______°__Ñ‹ _»_¸ÑˆÑŒ __ ___µ_±___»ÑŒÑˆ____ ÑÅÑ‚_µ_¿_µ___¸. _’___µÑÅÑ‚_µ ÑÅ ___µÑÅÑ‚__Ñ‹___¸ Ñ€_µ___µÑÅ_»_µ_____¸_º_°___¸ __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€ _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__ ÑÅ___·_´_°_» ÑÅ_µÑ€_¸Ñ_ _ºÑ€Ñƒ_¿_______°_±_°Ñ€_¸Ñ‚__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚ ÑÅ _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°___¸_µ__ ÑÅÑ€_µ_´___µ___µ_º________ ___¸Ñ‚Ñ€_°_¶______ Ñ‚_µÑ…___¸_º_¸, _º__Ñ‚__Ñ€_°Ñè _¿__ ÑÅ_µ__ _´_µ__ÑŒ Ñ€_°ÑÅ_¿Ñ€__ÑÅÑ‚Ñ€_°___µ___° __ Ñ€_µ___¸_____°Ñ… _¸ _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°___° __ __Ñ„__Ñ€___»_µ___¸_¸ _¥_°__ÑÅ_º______ _”____Ñ€Ñ†_° __ ____Ñ€___´_µ _¨_µ_º_¸. _’ _´_°________ ÑÅ_»ÑƒÑ‡_°_µ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º _·_°___µ___¸_» Ñ…Ñ€Ñƒ_¿_º___µ ÑÅÑ‚_µ_º_»__ ___° ___±Ñ€_µ_·_º_¸ ___µÑ‚_°_»_»_°, ___°___´_µ____Ñ‹_µ ____ _´____Ñ€_µ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸. _’ _¸Ñ‚_____µ Ñ€___¶_´_°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè ___µ_º_°Ñè ÑçÑÅÑ‚_µÑ‚_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º_°Ñè _¸__Ñ€_° _¸ ___° _¿__ÑçÑ‚_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹__ ____ÑÅÑ‚__Ñ‡__Ñ‹__ _´_µ_º__Ñ€ ___°_º_»_°_´Ñ‹___°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè _¿___»_¸Ñ‚_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º_¸__ _°ÑÅ_¿_µ_ºÑ‚. __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€ _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__  Ñ‡_°ÑÅÑ‚__ ___±Ñ€_°Ñ‰_°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè _º Ñ‚_µ___°__ _¶_¸_·___¸ __ ÑÅ_____±Ñ‰_µÑÅÑ‚___µ _¸ Ñ‚_µ___µ ___¸__Ñ€_°Ñ†_¸_¸, ___¿_¸Ñ€_°ÑèÑÅÑŒ ___° ÑÅ___±ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹__ _ºÑƒ_»ÑŒÑ‚ÑƒÑ€__Ñ‹__ ___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ _¸ ___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ _´Ñ€Ñƒ___¸Ñ… _»Ñ__´_µ__. _‘_»_°_____´_°Ñ€Ñè _¿Ñ€___´Ñƒ___°________Ñƒ ÑÅ__Ñ‚Ñ€Ñƒ_´___¸Ñ‡_µÑÅÑ‚__Ñƒ ÑÅ Ñˆ_µ_º_¸__ÑÅ_º____ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º____ _¸ ____Ñ€___´ÑÅ_º_¸___¸ ___»_°ÑÅÑ‚Ñè___¸, Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_ºÑƒ Ñƒ_´_°_»__ÑÅÑŒ Ñ€_°ÑÅ_ºÑ€Ñ‹Ñ‚ÑŒ Ñ‚_µ__Ñƒ Ñ‡_µÑ€_µ_· _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°____Ñ‹_µ __ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚_µ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»Ñ‹, _° Ñ‚_°_º_¶_µ Ñƒ_´_°_»__ÑÅÑŒ ___µÑ€__ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ ____Ñ‰____ÑÅÑ‚_¸ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸ _º _¶_¸_·___¸.__ÑƒÑ€_°Ñ‚__Ñ€ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: _¡Ñƒ_°_´ _“_°Ñ€_°_µ___°-_œ_°_»_µ_º_¸*_’Ñ‹Ñ€_°_¶_°_µ__ __ÑÅ___±ÑƒÑ_ _±_»_°_____´_°Ñ€____ÑÅÑ‚ÑŒ __O__ Tunc _¸ OAO Sheki Ipek.__Ñ‚_ºÑ€Ñ‹Ñ‚_¸_µ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: 11 ____Ñè_±Ñ€Ñè 2016-____ _____´_°, __ 19.00_ê_´Ñ€_µÑÅ: ___µ__Ñ‚Ñ€ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT (_Ÿ_»__Ñ‰_°_´ÑŒ _“__ÑÅÑƒ_´_°Ñ€ÑÅÑ‚___µ__________ ___»_°___°, _‘_°_¸_»______, AZ1003)_”_°Ñ‚_° __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: 11 _ù__Ñè_±Ñ€ÑŒ 2016 â€“ 29 _¯_____°Ñ€ÑŒ 2017_§_°ÑÅÑ‹ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚Ñ‹ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: _’Ñ‚__Ñ€___¸_º -

They soon became famous for their vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons they were avoided by most radio stations at first. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made their way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the prohibited words), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. Over the years popularity grew tremendously and after many TV and Film features, countless concerts and festival appearances all over the world, Leningrad is now one of the most renowned and legendary Russian bands attracting stadium-size crowds."""

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

The finale of the concert will be synchronized with a screening of Bischoff's video for ""Cistern,"" broadcast on numerous screens throughout Times Square.The concert will take place both nights on the Broadway Plaza between 43rd and 44th Sts. Arrive by 11:00pm to get your wireless headphones and before the 11:30pm performance. #CisternTSqImage Courtesy of Â©lovis ostenrik for @TSqArts"

Duncanson - http://cash-money-cartoons.tumblr.com/Show: 8PMScreaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

Landrieu was first elected to the Louisiana state legislature at the age of 23. In 1996 she became the first woman from Louisiana elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Senator Landrieu has been the leading voice in Washington for the Gulf Coast recovery effort. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the failures of the federal levee system, she secured billions in recovery dollars and has worked extensively to jumpstart recovery projects. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Senator Landrieu introduced the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act, which will, for the first time, direct 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties paid by BP directly to the Gulf Coast.ABOUT JEFF HEBERTJeff Hebert is the Executive Director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority where he is responsible for redevelopment projects for the City of New Orleans and the successful disposition of over 3,000 properties that were acquired through the stateâ€™s housing recovery program.Jeff found his way back home in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita serving as the Director of Community Planning for the Louisiana Recovery Authority where he was tasked with working with local governments throughout the state to develop recovery plans â€“ including the Unified New Orleans Plan.Jeff has received a Bachelors in Urban Design & Architecture Studies from NYU and a Masters of City Planning from MIT.Jeff is currently a board member of the Young Leadership Council, Second Harvest Food Bank, Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation and the United Way Vision Council.ABOUT DAVID WAGGONNERDavid Waggonner is the president of Waggonner & Ball Architects, an award-winning architecture and planning practice located in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is also the initiator of Dutch Dialogues, an exchange between Dutch engineering and design professionals and their American counterparts focused on water-based urban design. Over the course of three Dutch Dialogue conferences, David has articulated a new vision of New Orleans as a delta city living with â€“ rather than against â€“ water to address long-term development of urban character and form.David is currently leading a team of local and international experts to develop a Comprehensive Water Management Strategy for the Greater New Orleans region. Ultimately the teamsâ€™ goal is to develop a model of sustainable delta urbanism that embraces water in all its forms to improve safety and resiliency, grow the economy and provide public amenities. The plan is scheduled for completion in late 2012.SUPPORTBeyond the High Line is presented by Friends of the High Line in partnership with the Rails to Trails Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land.

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,Manhattan,6.97302E+14,"""The Last Days of Folly""",ART_EVENT,2014-09-03T17:30:00-0400,"One Night Only: Rachel Feinstein's The Last Days of Folly, a performance festival organized by the artist, will mark the final days of her exhibition in Madison Square Park. Weds., 9/3, 5:30PM to 8:30PM. View the schedule of performances here: http://goo.gl/0yFZzLMore info about the all-star lineup at http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/the-last-days-of-follyMadison Square Park Conservancy today announced that Rachel Feinsteinâ€™s Folly, three large-scale aluminum sculptures inspired by the artist-designed sets of the Ballets Russes, the improvisational spirit of the Commedia dellâ€™Arte, and decorative architecture commissioned by royals, will provide the backdrop for an evening of live performances, transforming Madison Square Park into a public theater on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Marking the final days of Feinsteinâ€™s Folly (open to the public through September 7, 2014), an exhibition of large scale sculptures that look like they could have come from a giant book of set designs but are, in fact, made of aluminum, will provide a fitting theatrical stage for a series of performances by contemporary artists, opera singers, musicians, puppets, dancers and more including:    MY BARBARIANMy Barbarian will present Broke Baroque Suite, an original operetta discussing topics of economics and art. The performers collaborate in chorus and solo numbers, including an aria by a soprano titled â€œI, Object,â€ù a baritone/tenor duet called â€œThe Artisanâ€™s Lament,â€ù and â€œThe Five Seasons,â€ù a dance-song. The audience will be involved in an improvisational incarnation of fortune- and future-telling.ALLISON BRAINARD and CARA CHANReferencing Commedia dellâ€™arte styles, Allison Brainard will choreograph a group of seven performers acting as harlequins. The performers will lead a raucous procession, travelling around the perimeter of the park and playfully moving park goers through the performance sites. They will enact simple improvised scores with each other, forming static tableaus and interacting with several instruments and sculptural elements created by Cara Chan. JARVIS COCKERInspired by Maurice Ravelâ€™s Daphnis et ChloÃ© for the Ballets Russes, Jarvis Cocker has created a musical interlude that will serve as a segue between the performances on the stage at Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House.SOFIA COPPOLAFilm Director Sofia Coppola, in collaboration with Joffrey Ballet Schoolâ€™s Director Jo Matos, and choreographer Irene Hogarth-Cimino and six young ballerinas will orchestrate a dance performance in response to the backdrop of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House. The ballerinas will dance to Isao Tomitaâ€™s re-orchestration of Claude Debussyâ€™s â€œArabesqueâ€ù. TAMAR ETTUN AND THE MOVING COMPANYTamar Ettun will stage a performance piece incorporating five colorful, simultaneously occurring sculptural and sound events. Six â€œmoversâ€ù will attempt to accomplish durational physical tasks while negotiating Feinsteinâ€™s outdoor sculptures, inflatable handmade balloons, and one another. Using a system of traditional rituals paired with postmodern dance concepts and gestures, the piece reflects on the human body in relation to deconstruction and stillness.LITTLE DID PRODUCTIONSAs Feinsteinâ€™s Folly brings European architecture from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Madison Square Park, Little Did Productions will bring fourth-century BCE India to Folly with verses from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Incorporating colorful overhead projections with found images from Indian shadow puppet theater, Little Didâ€™s narrator and co-artistic director, Luke Santy, in collaboration with Jessica Lorence, will lend sitar and vocal accompaniment to images projected onto Feinsteinâ€™s Rococo Hut.LIL BUCK with PAUL CANTELON and WOLFRAM KOESSELLil Buck is a Los Angeles-based street performer who specializes in jookinâ€™. He will perform two improvised dances in front of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House, accompanied by Paul Cantelon on piano and Wolfram Koessel on cello.KALUP LINZY with MIKE JACKSONRomantic Loner One Life To Heal is a visual musical melodrama of torch songs performed live by Kalup Linzy as characters Kaye Braswell and Taiwan Braswell, Kayeâ€™s presumed-dead cousin. Both are members of the fictitious Queen Rose family, who feature in Linzyâ€™s soap opera video series Conversations Wit De Churen, Melody Set Me Free, and As Da Art World Might Turns. The compositions are taken from Linzyâ€™s musical visual projects Sweetberry Sonnet and Romantic Loner, released in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The performance will also include portions of 2013's Conversations Wit De Churen X: One Life To Heal and will include live musical accompaniment by Mike Jackson.MOLLY LOWESensuality meets the grotesque in Molly Loweâ€™s performance beneath Feinsteinâ€™s Flying Ship. Relating the sense of touch and impressions of space, performers will don one large costume made of many nude suits sewn together, forming an undulating blob.ANGELA MCCLUSKEY and PAUL CANTELONSinger/composer duo Angela McCluskey and Paul Cantelon will present a series of musical performances from their extensive archive. In addition, they will perform a new original score inspired by Feinsteinâ€™s Folly.SHANA MOULTON with NICK HALLETT and DAISY PRESSShana Moulton will activate Rachel Feinstein's Rococo Hut sculpture with a musical performance that includes interactive video projections, yoghurt, cat toys and massage tools. Composer Nick Hallett will sing original music with vocalist Daisy Press to accompany the performance.TONY OURSLER and CONSTANCE DEJONGInspired by his childhood sailing along the Hudson River, along with his admiration of the Hudson River School of American painters, Tony Oursler, in collaboration with Constance DeJong, will present a new video projection of an animated fantasy on Feinsteinâ€™s Flying Ship.CARLOS VELA-PRADOWithin the context of the historical â€œfollyâ€ù premise, Carlos Vela-Prado will install inconspicuous sculptures and wireless speakers throughout Madison Square Park. They will emit soft-spoken voices, contributing to a soundscape that combines 1950s love songs, Fellini soundtracks, and traditional baroque strings with ambient and contemporary music. Vela-Pradoâ€™s audio selections will be restructured and mixed such as to confuse the individual parts while extending and incorporating each other into a textured ballad for Feinsteinâ€™s sculptures and the eveningâ€™s audience. Additionally, Feinstein has embarked on collaborations with some of todayâ€™s most notable fashion designers, including Giles Deacon, Duro Olowu, Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez, Cynthia Rowley, Proenza Schouler, and Madeline Weinrib. Each designer will create a new Folly-inspired look, to be presented in unexpected ways alongside the festival performances as they unfold. Giles Deacon will create a new dress for Rachel Feinstein to wear throughout her Last Days of Folly performance festival. The dress will be inspired by Marie Antoinette and Folly, Feinsteinâ€™s exhibition at Madison Square Park.Duro Olowu will display a runway piece from his Spring 2008 collection. His model will travel throughout the park over the course of the evening.Zac Posen will use the parkâ€™s Oval Lawn as a performative runway. Posen will incorporate between ten and fifteen of his Davidâ€™s Bridal wedding gowns into an animated showcase using both live models and puppeteers.Narciso Rodriguez will create costumes for The Last Days of Folly performers Tamar Ettun and the Moving Company.Cynthia Rowley will create a â€œfountain dressâ€ù for a model to wear in the reflecting pool at the north end of Madison Square Park. Inspired by Gelsomina, the ingÃ©nue of Federico Felliniâ€™s La Strada, Proenza Schouler will create costumes for three clownish performers who will entertain park goers throughout the festival.Madeline Weinrib will adorn the stage area in front of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House with a tableau of carpets inspired by a range of global cultures.""Eavesdropping on peopleâ€™s conversations in front of my sculptures and watching the public interact with them started my thoughts towards The Last Days of Folly. The interaction with people is what makes the sculptures pop. I became inspired to curate a performance festival using live theatre, colorful costumes, and different movements, forms and shapes to juxtapose the flatness, stillness, and whiteness of my sculptures,â€ù Feinstein explains. â€œBeing an artist is a solitary process, and through working with other artists I admire and who are successful in their different fields to make this festival happen I have learned so much.â€ù  â€œRachel Feinstein has long wanted to activate, through public performances, her three sculptures in Madison Square Park,â€ù said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Martin Friedman Senior Curator at the Conservancy. â€œShe has organized an exciting and diverse group of artists, designers, musicians, puppeteers and dancers to program an evening akin to one of her primary inspirations, Commedia dellâ€™arte.â€ùThe Last Days of Folly takes place at Madison Square Park, 23rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Rain or shine. About Folly:Rachel Feinsteinâ€™s Folly (on view in Madison Square Park through September 7, 2014), the artistâ€™s first public art exhibition in the United States, consists of three monumental sculptures that evoke the architectural â€œfolliesâ€ù for which they are named â€“ structures built with decorative rather than functional purpose, most popular in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century landscape design. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff, a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a mast extending to the ground. Feinsteinâ€™s sculptures reference theatrical sources like Ballets Russes backdrops and Commedia dellâ€™arte stories, and their effect is that of a Fellini film set dropped into the middle of New York City. Feinsteinâ€™s exhibition allows park goers to stumble into surprising cinematic worlds."

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,Manhattan,9.61067E+14,Kota Ezawa: City of Nature,null,2011-03-31T11:00:00-0700,"Kota Ezawa is a German-born, San Fransisco-based video artist and illustrator who creates simple, graphic illustrations over film footage to produce short, witty narrative videos. City of Nature, Ezawaâ€™s original video commission for Mad. Sq. Art, weaves together excerpts from popular films, ranging from Fitzcarraldo to Twin Peaks in which nature is the only character featured onscreen.  These short clips are edited together to form what the artist calls a â€œvideo collageâ€ù or seamless montage, before being translated through freehand, computer assisted digital animation.  The resulting animated video stands as a visually striking and original work containing subtle, but deliberate echoes of iconic cultural moments embedded in our collective unconscious.  In much the same way that Madison Square Park presents a cultivated and aestheticized side of nature, wildlife and green space amidst the urban landscape of central Manhattan, City of Nature examines the ways in which popular culture presents aestheticized images of the natural work, â€œunnaturalâ€ù visions of nature that embed themselves in our cultural memory and media landscape more deeply than we may consciously know.The video will run daily from 11am to 9pm, Mar 31 to May 15."

Artist Kimsooja spent several days at the center and asked the residents about their lives, background, families and memories. She spent time getting to know them, gaining their trust and support and then filmed them over a period of two weeks. Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.http://link.sva.edu/fVHz7G"

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,Manhattan,5.20896E+14,Pranayama: A Science Beyond Breath with Sn. Shivakripa,WORKSHOP,2016-07-15T18:30:00-0400,"Sn. Shivakripa,a karma Sannyasi and Shikshaka of Atmadarshana yogashram, Bengaluru, India.Pranayama is not just breathing practices, and prana is not just air that we breath. Breath is the external manifestation of prana, and prana is that subtle energy that can be enhanced with breath. Breathing exercises only oxygenate our bodies, whereas pranayama practices awaken the prana Shakti within us.Pranayama is a science which is related to our breath and more so to the subtle flowing energies in this breath, which is known as prana. Prana exists within each one of us in a dormant form. When we practice pranayama, the quantity of this vital energy in the body is activated to a higher frequency, gearing us towards maintaining a healthy body and mind.Diseases are the manifestation of an imbalance in the flow of prana within us. Pranayama reduces these blockages and replaces them with more and more prana, resulting in balance and harmony within and outside us.At the physical level, these practices help in controlling and alleviating high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, rheumatism, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholesterol, fat, headaches, sinusitis, and various other ailments caused due to shallow breathing. At the spiritual level, these practices are said to be a direct link to our higher consciousness, the Paramatma.All participants please make sure to wear natural fiber clothes, and ensure that your last meal is 3 hours prior to the workshop.Register Here!http://reflectionsyoga.com/event/pranayama/"

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

In this revitalization of traditional format, the audience will move between constellations of dancers in dizzying sequences of movement and ever-changing levels and locations.

Duncanson - http://cash-money-cartoons.tumblr.com/Show: 8PMScreaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

Weds., 9/3, 5:30PM to 8:30PM. View the schedule of performances here: http://goo.gl/0yFZzLMore info about the all-star lineup at http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/the-last-days-of-follyMadison Square Park Conservancy today announced that Rachel Feinsteinâ€™s Folly, three large-scale aluminum sculptures inspired by the artist-designed sets of the Ballets Russes, the improvisational spirit of the Commedia dellâ€™Arte, and decorative architecture commissioned by royals, will provide the backdrop for an evening of live performances, transforming Madison Square Park into a public theater on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Marking the final days of Feinsteinâ€™s Folly (open to the public through September 7, 2014), an exhibition of large scale sculptures that look like they could have come from a giant book of set designs but are, in fact, made of aluminum, will provide a fitting theatrical stage for a series of performances by contemporary artists, opera singers, musicians, puppets, dancers and more including:    MY BARBARIANMy Barbarian will present Broke Baroque Suite, an original operetta discussing topics of economics and art. The performers collaborate in chorus and solo numbers, including an aria by a soprano titled â€œI, Object,â€ù a baritone/tenor duet called â€œThe Artisanâ€™s Lament,â€ù and â€œThe Five Seasons,â€ù a dance-song. The audience will be involved in an improvisational incarnation of fortune- and future-telling.ALLISON BRAINARD and CARA CHANReferencing Commedia dellâ€™arte styles, Allison Brainard will choreograph a group of seven performers acting as harlequins. The performers will lead a raucous procession, travelling around the perimeter of the park and playfully moving park goers through the performance sites. They will enact simple improvised scores with each other, forming static tableaus and interacting with several instruments and sculptural elements created by Cara Chan. JARVIS COCKERInspired by Maurice Ravelâ€™s Daphnis et ChloÃ© for the Ballets Russes, Jarvis Cocker has created a musical interlude that will serve as a segue between the performances on the stage at Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House.SOFIA COPPOLAFilm Director Sofia Coppola, in collaboration with Joffrey Ballet Schoolâ€™s Director Jo Matos, and choreographer Irene Hogarth-Cimino and six young ballerinas will orchestrate a dance performance in response to the backdrop of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House. The ballerinas will dance to Isao Tomitaâ€™s re-orchestration of Claude Debussyâ€™s â€œArabesqueâ€ù. TAMAR ETTUN AND THE MOVING COMPANYTamar Ettun will stage a performance piece incorporating five colorful, simultaneously occurring sculptural and sound events. Six â€œmoversâ€ù will attempt to accomplish durational physical tasks while negotiating Feinsteinâ€™s outdoor sculptures, inflatable handmade balloons, and one another. Using a system of traditional rituals paired with postmodern dance concepts and gestures, the piece reflects on the human body in relation to deconstruction and stillness.LITTLE DID PRODUCTIONSAs Feinsteinâ€™s Folly brings European architecture from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Madison Square Park, Little Did Productions will bring fourth-century BCE India to Folly with verses from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Incorporating colorful overhead projections with found images from Indian shadow puppet theater, Little Didâ€™s narrator and co-artistic director, Luke Santy, in collaboration with Jessica Lorence, will lend sitar and vocal accompaniment to images projected onto Feinsteinâ€™s Rococo Hut.LIL BUCK with PAUL CANTELON and WOLFRAM KOESSELLil Buck is a Los Angeles-based street performer who specializes in jookinâ€™. He will perform two improvised dances in front of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House, accompanied by Paul Cantelon on piano and Wolfram Koessel on cello.KALUP LINZY with MIKE JACKSONRomantic Loner One Life To Heal is a visual musical melodrama of torch songs performed live by Kalup Linzy as characters Kaye Braswell and Taiwan Braswell, Kayeâ€™s presumed-dead cousin. Both are members of the fictitious Queen Rose family, who feature in Linzyâ€™s soap opera video series Conversations Wit De Churen, Melody Set Me Free, and As Da Art World Might Turns. The compositions are taken from Linzyâ€™s musical visual projects Sweetberry Sonnet and Romantic Loner, released in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The performance will also include portions of 2013's Conversations Wit De Churen X: One Life To Heal and will include live musical accompaniment by Mike Jackson.MOLLY LOWESensuality meets the grotesque in Molly Loweâ€™s performance beneath Feinsteinâ€™s Flying Ship. Relating the sense of touch and impressions of space, performers will don one large costume made of many nude suits sewn together, forming an undulating blob.ANGELA MCCLUSKEY and PAUL CANTELONSinger/composer duo Angela McCluskey and Paul Cantelon will present a series of musical performances from their extensive archive. In addition, they will perform a new original score inspired by Feinsteinâ€™s Folly.SHANA MOULTON with NICK HALLETT and DAISY PRESSShana Moulton will activate Rachel Feinstein's Rococo Hut sculpture with a musical performance that includes interactive video projections, yoghurt, cat toys and massage tools. Composer Nick Hallett will sing original music with vocalist Daisy Press to accompany the performance.TONY OURSLER and CONSTANCE DEJONGInspired by his childhood sailing along the Hudson River, along with his admiration of the Hudson River School of American painters, Tony Oursler, in collaboration with Constance DeJong, will present a new video projection of an animated fantasy on Feinsteinâ€™s Flying Ship.CARLOS VELA-PRADOWithin the context of the historical â€œfollyâ€ù premise, Carlos Vela-Prado will install inconspicuous sculptures and wireless speakers throughout Madison Square Park. They will emit soft-spoken voices, contributing to a soundscape that combines 1950s love songs, Fellini soundtracks, and traditional baroque strings with ambient and contemporary music. Vela-Pradoâ€™s audio selections will be restructured and mixed such as to confuse the individual parts while extending and incorporating each other into a textured ballad for Feinsteinâ€™s sculptures and the eveningâ€™s audience. Additionally, Feinstein has embarked on collaborations with some of todayâ€™s most notable fashion designers, including Giles Deacon, Duro Olowu, Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez, Cynthia Rowley, Proenza Schouler, and Madeline Weinrib. Each designer will create a new Folly-inspired look, to be presented in unexpected ways alongside the festival performances as they unfold. Giles Deacon will create a new dress for Rachel Feinstein to wear throughout her Last Days of Folly performance festival. The dress will be inspired by Marie Antoinette and Folly, Feinsteinâ€™s exhibition at Madison Square Park.Duro Olowu will display a runway piece from his Spring 2008 collection. His model will travel throughout the park over the course of the evening.Zac Posen will use the parkâ€™s Oval Lawn as a performative runway. Posen will incorporate between ten and fifteen of his Davidâ€™s Bridal wedding gowns into an animated showcase using both live models and puppeteers.Narciso Rodriguez will create costumes for The Last Days of Folly performers Tamar Ettun and the Moving Company.Cynthia Rowley will create a â€œfountain dressâ€ù for a model to wear in the reflecting pool at the north end of Madison Square Park. Inspired by Gelsomina, the ingÃ©nue of Federico Felliniâ€™s La Strada, Proenza Schouler will create costumes for three clownish performers who will entertain park goers throughout the festival.Madeline Weinrib will adorn the stage area in front of Feinsteinâ€™s Cliff House with a tableau of carpets inspired by a range of global cultures.""Eavesdropping on peopleâ€™s conversations in front of my sculptures and watching the public interact with them started my thoughts towards The Last Days of Folly. The interaction with people is what makes the sculptures pop. I became inspired to curate a performance festival using live theatre, colorful costumes, and different movements, forms and shapes to juxtapose the flatness, stillness, and whiteness of my sculptures,â€ù Feinstein explains. â€œBeing an artist is a solitary process, and through working with other artists I admire and who are successful in their different fields to make this festival happen I have learned so much.â€ù  â€œRachel Feinstein has long wanted to activate, through public performances, her three sculptures in Madison Square Park,â€ù said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Martin Friedman Senior Curator at the Conservancy. â€œShe has organized an exciting and diverse group of artists, designers, musicians, puppeteers and dancers to program an evening akin to one of her primary inspirations, Commedia dellâ€™arte.â€ùThe Last Days of Folly takes place at Madison Square Park, 23rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Rain or shine. About Folly:Rachel Feinsteinâ€™s Folly (on view in Madison Square Park through September 7, 2014), the artistâ€™s first public art exhibition in the United States, consists of three monumental sculptures that evoke the architectural â€œfolliesâ€ù for which they are named â€“ structures built with decorative rather than functional purpose, most popular in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century landscape design. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff, a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a mast extending to the ground. Feinsteinâ€™s sculptures reference theatrical sources like Ballets Russes backdrops and Commedia dellâ€™arte stories, and their effect is that of a Fellini film set dropped into the middle of New York City. Feinsteinâ€™s exhibition allows park goers to stumble into surprising cinematic worlds."

Sq. Art, weaves together excerpts from popular films, ranging from Fitzcarraldo to Twin Peaks in which nature is the only character featured onscreen.  These short clips are edited together to form what the artist calls a â€œvideo collageâ€ù or seamless montage, before being translated through freehand, computer assisted digital animation.  The resulting animated video stands as a visually striking and original work containing subtle, but deliberate echoes of iconic cultural moments embedded in our collective unconscious.  In much the same way that Madison Square Park presents a cultivated and aestheticized side of nature, wildlife and green space amidst the urban landscape of central Manhattan, City of Nature examines the ways in which popular culture presents aestheticized images of the natural work, â€œunnaturalâ€ù visions of nature that embed themselves in our cultural memory and media landscape more deeply than we may consciously know.The video will run daily from 11am to 9pm, Mar 31 to May 15."

Artist Kimsooja spent several days at the center and asked the residents about their lives, background, families and memories. She spent time getting to know them, gaining their trust and support and then filmed them over a period of two weeks. Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.http://link.sva.edu/fVHz7G"

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,Manhattan,5.20896E+14,Pranayama: A Science Beyond Breath with Sn. Shivakripa,WORKSHOP,2016-07-15T18:30:00-0400,"Sn. Shivakripa,a karma Sannyasi and Shikshaka of Atmadarshana yogashram, Bengaluru, India.Pranayama is not just breathing practices, and prana is not just air that we breath. Breath is the external manifestation of prana, and prana is that subtle energy that can be enhanced with breath. Breathing exercises only oxygenate our bodies, whereas pranayama practices awaken the prana Shakti within us.Pranayama is a science which is related to our breath and more so to the subtle flowing energies in this breath, which is known as prana. Prana exists within each one of us in a dormant form. When we practice pranayama, the quantity of this vital energy in the body is activated to a higher frequency, gearing us towards maintaining a healthy body and mind.Diseases are the manifestation of an imbalance in the flow of prana within us. Pranayama reduces these blockages and replaces them with more and more prana, resulting in balance and harmony within and outside us.At the physical level, these practices help in controlling and alleviating high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, rheumatism, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholesterol, fat, headaches, sinusitis, and various other ailments caused due to shallow breathing. At the spiritual level, these practices are said to be a direct link to our higher consciousness, the Paramatma.All participants please make sure to wear natural fiber clothes, and ensure that your last meal is 3 hours prior to the workshop.Register Here!http://reflectionsyoga.com/event/pranayama/"

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

Duncanson - http://cash-money-cartoons.tumblr.com/Show: 8PMScreaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

In public, O-Ei knows and respects ""her place,"" but at home in the studio, she's as brash and uninhibited as her father, smoking a pipe while sketching erotic drawings that would make contemporary Japanese ladies blush. But despite her talent and fiercely independent spirit, O-Ei struggles under the domineering influence of her father and is ridiculed for lacking the life experience that she is attempting to portray in her art. MISS HOKUSAI's lively Edo (present day Tokyo) is filled with yokai spirits, dragons, and conniving tradesmen, while O-Ei's relationships with her famously impetuous father and blind younger sister provide a powerful emotional underpinning to this rollicking and sumptuously-animated feminist coming-of-age tale.Director: Keiichi HaraLanguage: Japanese with English subtitles"

Upper East Side,Manhattan,9.20641E+14,MMC Dance Presents Twyla Tharp's THE ONE HUNDREDS,null,2011-05-01T13:00:00-0700,"May 1, 2011Performances: Sunday May 1, 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.Location: Theresa Lang Theatre, Marymount Manhattan College, 221 East 71st Street, NYCost: FreeContact: Anthony Ferro, M.F.A., associate professor of dance, (212) 517-0613Marymount Manhattan dance majors, the MMC community and friends present Twyla Tharpâ€™s THE ONE HUNDREDS on Sunday, May 1 in the Theresa Lang Theatre, 221 East 71st Street, New York City. Two performances are scheduled at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Free admission and no reservations necessary.The MMC dance majors have been working with the Tharp choreographic material during the spring semester and they are now prepared to share their experience with other dancers, dance enthusiasts and individuals who love movement and movement invention. Veteran Tharp dancers Rose Marie Wright and Jennifer Way have been on campus contributing their expertise and assisting Associate Professor of Dance Anthony Ferro â€™01, M.F.A., in mounting the work. Professor of Dance Katie Langan â€™92 B.A., who also serves as chair of the MMC dance department and Ferro are former dancers with Twyla Tharp Dance.Twyla Tharpâ€™s THE ONE HUNDREDS was first performed in 1970. In her words, the dance is â€œ...an exercise in aesthetic and physical deterioration. This dance is a series of 100 11-second movement phrases performed in three sections. In the first section, two skilled dancers, in unison, perform 100 movement phrases separated by four seconds of stillness (approximately 25 minutes); in the second section, five dancers perform 20 phrases each without pause (approximately five minutes); and in the third section, 100 people perform one phrase each (11 seconds). The movements are based on activities that anyone, including untrained dancers, could doâ€”such as skip, hop, shiver, and shakeâ€”and are performed in silence. As the time diminishes, so does the rigor and definition of the dancing. And at the climactic display of 100 soloists, the phrases become mere shadows of themselves."

W. Dunneâ€™s theory of serial time, attesting that time is not merely a linear progression, but a concept that simultaneously contains past, present and future. The play follows the story of the seemingly perfect Conway familyâ€”Act One presents their perfect day, Act Two their worst day, and Act Three, the realization that their travails have paralleled the vanquished ideals of the British people between the wars. This production is performed by students in the Theatre Arts programs of the College with direction by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts Kevin Connell, scenic design by Sofia Palacios Blanca, costume design by Elise Vanderkley, lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, sound design by Meghan Rose Murphy, and dialect and text coaching by Professor of Theatre Arts Barbara Adrian. General admission tickets are $10. Tickets for senior citizens and students of others schools (with valid ID) are $5, and admission is free of charge for MMC students, alumni, faculty, and staff (with valid MMC ID).

Two performances are scheduled at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Free admission and no reservations necessary.The MMC dance majors have been working with the Tharp choreographic material during the spring semester and they are now prepared to share their experience with other dancers, dance enthusiasts and individuals who love movement and movement invention. Veteran Tharp dancers Rose Marie Wright and Jennifer Way have been on campus contributing their expertise and assisting Associate Professor of Dance Anthony Ferro â€™01, M.F.A., in mounting the work. Professor of Dance Katie Langan â€™92 B.A., who also serves as chair of the MMC dance department and Ferro are former dancers with Twyla Tharp Dance.Twyla Tharpâ€™s THE ONE HUNDREDS was first performed in 1970. In her words, the dance is â€œ...an exercise in aesthetic and physical deterioration. This dance is a series of 100 11-second movement phrases performed in three sections. In the first section, two skilled dancers, in unison, perform 100 movement phrases separated by four seconds of stillness (approximately 25 minutes); in the second section, five dancers perform 20 phrases each without pause (approximately five minutes); and in the third section, 100 people perform one phrase each (11 seconds). The movements are based on activities that anyone, including untrained dancers, could doâ€”such as skip, hop, shiver, and shakeâ€”and are performed in silence. As the time diminishes, so does the rigor and definition of the dancing. And at the climactic display of 100 soloists, the phrases become mere shadows of themselves."

ASL accessible seating is available upon request when reserving tickets.Marymount Manhattan College Theatre Production Workshop presents a revival of Time and the Conways by J.B. Priestly from Wednesday, March 9 through Saturday, March 12 at 8 p.m. and on Sunday, March 13 at 2 p.m. in the Theresa Lang Theatre, located at 221 East 71st Street. Time and the Conways (1937) is a meditation on J. W. Dunneâ€™s theory of serial time, attesting that time is not merely a linear progression, but a concept that simultaneously contains past, present and future. The play follows the story of the seemingly perfect Conway familyâ€”Act One presents their perfect day, Act Two their worst day, and Act Three, the realization that their travails have paralleled the vanquished ideals of the British people between the wars. This production is performed by students in the Theatre Arts programs of the College with direction by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts Kevin Connell, scenic design by Sofia Palacios Blanca, costume design by Elise Vanderkley, lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, sound design by Meghan Rose Murphy, and dialect and text coaching by Professor of Theatre Arts Barbara Adrian. General admission tickets are $10. Tickets for senior citizens and students of others schools (with valid ID) are $5, and admission is free of charge for MMC students, alumni, faculty, and staff (with valid MMC ID). TDF vouchers are accepted. For further information, and to reserve tickets beginning February 23, call (212) 774-0760 or e-mail: TheatreTickets@mmm.edu. Be sure to include your full name, phone number, the desired performance date, and number of tickets.

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

Get yours here: http://bit.ly/osb-mixpak ====Featuring DJ Sets From===////// Murlo///// Dre Skull//// The Large// Wildlife! / Special guest Bobby Konders of Massive B Soundsystem/Hot 97MixpakMixpak is a Brooklyn-based record label, founded in 2009 by producer Dre Skull. Home to some of Jamaicaâ€™s biggest stars, Mixpak has released full length albums with Vybz Kartel and Popcaan as well as riddim releases featuring Beenie Man, Machel Montano, Tifa, Spice and more. Bobby Konders DJ and producer Bobby Konders started his own record label Massive B over 20 years ago. After producing the reggae/hip-hop smash â€œMack Daddyâ€ù with Salaam Remi and a now classic remix for Supercatâ€™s â€œGhetto Red Hot,â€ù Massive B became a go-to for dancehall and reggae acts in New York and beyond. While the label released records by Burro Banton, Nicodemus, King Kong, Junior Reid, Sizzla, Richie Spice, and more, the crew took up their now longstanding Sunday-night slot on Hot 97, as well as presenting New Yorkâ€™s yearly â€œOn Da Reggae Tip,â€ù a much-loved float at the West Indian Day Parade, and the weekly dancehall party â€œFire Sundaysâ€ù in Queens.				MurloInfluenced as much by the sonic narratives of film scores as by U.K. dance music, DJ and producer Murlo works together the discombobulated sounds and mutations of the current clubland with the Afro-Caribbean rhythms that historically underpin Londonâ€™s dance culture.Dre Skull Dre Skull became a producer and label owner of Mixpak after collaborating with Jamaican superstar Vybz Kartel on the full-length â€œKingston Storyâ€ù for Mixpak. Since then, he has worked with Popcaan, Pusha T, Beenie Man, Jamie XX, How to Dress Well, Snoop Lion, and more, following the legendary paths of Don Was and Rick Rubin in the school of any-genre-goes. The LargeThe Large was raised in Bristol, U.K., surrounded by the vibes of Massive Attack, Tricky, and St Paulâ€™s Carnival. Starting out as resident at the Heatwaveâ€™s legendary â€œHot Wukâ€ù party in London, she now lives in NYC where she acts as the official spirit guide for Mixpak. Wildlife! After years of touring his own soundsystem and studying audio engineering, Wildlife! turned his hand to production, making left-field riddims with Jamaican artist Terry Lynn, straight-up club productions, and releasing two full albums under his experimental electronic-music moniker, Young Palace. In 2015, he finished up his Master of Arts degree in contemporary-arts practice, and has since had sound-installation work featured in gallery exhibitions worldwide. Enter through the Weston Pavilion entrance on Columbus Avenue at 79th Street"

Mann and the Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning political cartoonist Tom Toles have fought at the frontlines of climate-change denialism for most of their careers. Their brilliant, colorful book takes aim at the manipulation of the media by business and political interests and the play to partisanship on issues that affect the well-being of millions. Tolesâ€™s cartoons expose the bias of such counter-scientific strategies and Mannâ€™s expert skills at science communication restore sanity to a debate that continues to rage against widely acknowledged scientific consensus. The synergy of these two common-sense crusaders enlivens the dour tone of so many climate-themed screedsâ€”and may even convert a few of the faithful deniers to the right side of science.Note: A book signing will follow. About the SpeakersMichael E. Mann is Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science and director of the Earth Systems Science Center at Penn State University. He is the author of The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines (Columbia, 2012) and a fellow of the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Tom Toles is the Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning cartoonist of the Washington Post.

Surely, theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends, dogmatic beliefs, or flights of fancy? In fact, acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else.

A book signing will follow.Roger Penrose, the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics Emeritus at the University of Oxford, is one the worldâ€™s foremost theoretical physicists and has won numerous prizes, including the Albert Einstein Medal, for his fundamental contributions to general relativity and cosmology.

Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkersâ€™ supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to â€œnever go there,â€ù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Squareâ€™s unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.#ResidencyTSq"

Duncanson - http://cash-money-cartoons.tumblr.com/Show: 8PMScreaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandâ€™s songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smithâ€™s Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys."

Elias Pavlopoulos and Scott A. Small discuss their new study, the science of age-related memory loss, and the prospects for helping people recover their ability to remember.Recently, researchers with the Kavli Institute for Brain Science (KIBS) at Columbia University found compelling evidence that age-related memory loss is a syndrome in its own right, apart from Alzheimerâ€™s. In fact, in the case of one type of age-related memory loss  -- again, distinct from Alzheimer's -- researchers were able to restore memory function in mice so that it was comparable to that of young mice. These are exciting findings that, along with implications for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of memory disorders, may in the future have significant public health consequences.Submit a question for the team on Twitter using #KavliLive."

The instruments are from Indonesia with home-made additions. The music is written by the group of composer-performers, each in their unique styles, as well as traditional music of Bali and Java.Gamelan Son of Lion â€“ which is based on New York City - bridges two musical words: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia, employing instruments from Indonesia with homemade additions. There are about 100 active gamelan ensembles in the United States, and Gamelan Son of Lion rates among the oldest of these, having performed continuously for 40 years. It is also one of the few in this country that operate independently of institutions as a professional music ensemble.The New York Times described the ensemble as â€œthe most prominent New York-area manifestation of a fascinating nationwide movement.â€ù The ensemble â€“ which was co-founded by a trip of composers, Barbara Benary, Daniel Goode, and Philip Corner in the 1970s, and became incorporated in 1980 â€“ has routinely performed experimental works by Indonesian composers, many involving gamelan with electronic music, and several theatre works involving opera, wayang kulit, multimedia and dance.At Flushing Town Hallâ€™s event, performers will include: Barbara Benary (Artistic Director) , David Demnitz, Daniel Goode, Nicholas Klinovsky, Jody Kruskal, Skip LaPlante,  Laura Liben, Layne Negrin, Myles Robert, Larry Simon and Sima Wolf.â€œOur ensemble, unlike orchestras, is a democratic affair in which most of the musicians can play most of the instruments, and do switch parts frequently with different compositions,â€ù says Co-founder Barbara Benary. â€œSo no one is the soloist and many people are.â€ùTickets: $16/$10 Members & Students"

The instruments are from Indonesia with home-made additions. The music is written by the group of composer-performers, each in their unique styles, as well as traditional music of Bali and Java.Gamelan Son of Lion â€“ which is based on New York City - bridges two musical words: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia, employing instruments from Indonesia with homemade additions. There are about 100 active gamelan ensembles in the United States, and Gamelan Son of Lion rates among the oldest of these, having performed continuously for 40 years. It is also one of the few in this country that operate independently of institutions as a professional music ensemble.The New York Times described the ensemble as â€œthe most prominent New York-area manifestation of a fascinating nationwide movement.â€ù The ensemble â€“ which was co-founded by a trip of composers, Barbara Benary, Daniel Goode, and Philip Corner in the 1970s, and became incorporated in 1980 â€“ has routinely performed experimental works by Indonesian composers, many involving gamelan with electronic music, and several theatre works involving opera, wayang kulit, multimedia and dance.At Flushing Town Hallâ€™s event, performers will include: Barbara Benary (Artistic Director) , David Demnitz, Daniel Goode, Nicholas Klinovsky, Jody Kruskal, Skip LaPlante,  Laura Liben, Layne Negrin, Myles Robert, Larry Simon and Sima Wolf.â€œOur ensemble, unlike orchestras, is a democratic affair in which most of the musicians can play most of the instruments, and do switch parts frequently with different compositions,â€ù says Co-founder Barbara Benary. â€œSo no one is the soloist and many people are.â€ùTickets: $16/$10 Members & Students"

Ajarn Chai came to the United States with a vision to spread Muay Thai throughout the world, and he is the first-ever Thai boxing instructor to teach Americans this art. He has worked tirelessly for 40 years to that end. We are indeed grateful to Ajarn Chai for his gift of the knowledge of Muay Thai.The TBA-USA now has representation in almost every state in the USA and has expanded to establish affiliate organizations in more than 15 countries around the world.Ajarn Surachai Sirisute recently went into semi-retirement, consequently limiting his seminar engagements to only 4 or 5 per year in the United States. He has chosen to do this upcoming seminar in New York and we are honored to have him. Please take this rare opportunity to train with the man that helped bring Thai boxing to the United States and take it to the phenomenon that it is now.Pre-Reg (Before May 12)1 DAY $125 2 DAYS $200After May 121 DAY $150 2 DAYS $250"

In 2003, Leckeyâ€™s first Sound System performance, 'BigBoxStatueAction' at Tate Britain, featured one of his speaker towers with Jacob Epsteinâ€™s classic modernist sculpture, Jacob and the Angel (1940-41), blasting songs ranging from the Beach Boysâ€™ â€œOur Prayerâ€ù to Throbbing Gristleâ€™s â€œPersuasion.â€ù  In doing so Leckey contrasted Epsteinâ€™s massive alabaster sculpture, inherently static, silent and invariable with the fleeting, continuously changing and invisible material that is sound. Far from a critique of sculpture, Leckey considers this acoustic set-up a different form of art appreciation: one that is intuitive and communal.Following the performance, Leckey will speak with two of the exhibitionâ€™s curators, Peter Eleey, Curator and Associate Director of Exhibitions and Programs, MoMA PS1, and Stuart Comer, Chief Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art."

In 2003, Leckeyâ€™s first Sound System performance, 'BigBoxStatueAction' at Tate Britain, featured one of his speaker towers with Jacob Epsteinâ€™s classic modernist sculpture, Jacob and the Angel (1940-41), blasting songs ranging from the Beach Boysâ€™ â€œOur Prayerâ€ù to Throbbing Gristleâ€™s â€œPersuasion.â€ù  In doing so Leckey contrasted Epsteinâ€™s massive alabaster sculpture, inherently static, silent and invariable with the fleeting, continuously changing and invisible material that is sound. Far from a critique of sculpture, Leckey considers this acoustic set-up a different form of art appreciation: one that is intuitive and communal.Following the performance, Leckey will speak with two of the exhibitionâ€™s curators, Peter Eleey, Curator and Associate Director of Exhibitions and Programs, MoMA PS1, and Stuart Comer, Chief Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art."

The Dr's sent me for a 2 hour fetal echo where they look at every part of her heart...It was recommended I abort. We then flew to Boston where they told us she only had a 75% chance of living until she was 3. Then we went to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they explained exactly what Valentina had and the 3 heart surgeries she would be getting to ""fix"" her heart.  The first at 3 days old the 2nd at 6 months old and her 3rd at 2-3 years old.She was born in Philadelphia on February 15th with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome which is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is underdeveloped so her right ventricle is doing the work for both. She also has Heterotaxy, which is where her heart and some of her organs are reversed, and Asplenia, which means she has no spleen.On February 18th she had her 1st surgery which went amazing.  We were home 8 days later. Her second surgery was scheduled for August 28 but on July 10 her oxygen level dropped and she was transported to Philadelphia to have surgery that week. The surgery went well but her recovery wasn't great. She got sick and ended up coming home a month later. Because of her heterotaxy her intestines were mal rotated,  so in November she had surgery to correct them.We were lucky enough to be able to be with our daughter through her surgeries and stay in a hotel close to the hospital. Being there we met many families that weren't able to afford to stay near the hospital and families that couldn't take off work to be with their babies all day. A portion of the money that we are donating to the hospital is going to the cardiac social work department so they can help the families be able to make it work so they can be with their babies.  Another portion is going to the cardiac child life program which is so special. Some of these cardiac babies are there for months at a time, like one of valentina's  roommates who was there from the day he was born until his 1st birthday where he received his heart transplant. So the cardiac child life tries to make these children's stays a little bit more enjoyable with games, arts and crafts and music class.And the last portion is going to cardiac research because hopefully Valentina will get to grow up get married have babies and live a long fulfilling life which if she was born 30 years ago, she probably wouldn't have been able to.$50 donations to take part in our fundraiser!Non-members are allowed to participate with a Valid Photo IDMinors must be accompanied by a parent. Parent and child must present a valid photo id."

Southwest Queens,Queens,1.44907E+15,Lift-A-Thon/ Cardio-A-Thon Fundraiser for Team Valentina!,null,2014-02-23T10:00:00-0500,"At 18 weeks pregnant I was told they couldn't see the 4 chambers in valentina's heart. The Dr's sent me for a 2 hour fetal echo where they look at every part of her heart...It was recommended I abort. We then flew to Boston where they told us she only had a 75% chance of living until she was 3. Then we went to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they explained exactly what Valentina had and the 3 heart surgeries she would be getting to ""fix"" her heart.  The first at 3 days old the 2nd at 6 months old and her 3rd at 2-3 years old.She was born in Philadelphia on February 15th with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome which is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is underdeveloped so her right ventricle is doing the work for both. She also has Heterotaxy, which is where her heart and some of her organs are reversed, and Asplenia, which means she has no spleen.On February 18th she had her 1st surgery which went amazing.  We were home 8 days later. Her second surgery was scheduled for August 28 but on July 10 her oxygen level dropped and she was transported to Philadelphia to have surgery that week. The surgery went well but her recovery wasn't great. She got sick and ended up coming home a month later. Because of her heterotaxy her intestines were mal rotated,  so in November she had surgery to correct them.We were lucky enough to be able to be with our daughter through her surgeries and stay in a hotel close to the hospital. Being there we met many families that weren't able to afford to stay near the hospital and families that couldn't take off work to be with their babies all day. A portion of the money that we are donating to the hospital is going to the cardiac social work department so they can help the families be able to make it work so they can be with their babies.  Another portion is going to the cardiac child life program which is so special. Some of these cardiac babies are there for months at a time, like one of valentina's  roommates who was there from the day he was born until his 1st birthday where he received his heart transplant. So the cardiac child life tries to make these children's stays a little bit more enjoyable with games, arts and crafts and music class.And the last portion is going to cardiac research because hopefully Valentina will get to grow up get married have babies and live a long fulfilling life which if she was born 30 years ago, she probably wouldn't have been able to.$50 donations to take part in our fundraiser!Non-members are allowed to participate with a Valid Photo IDMinors must be accompanied by a parent.

Participants will learn about the history of the site and gain the perspectives of the Sanitation and Parks Departments on the transformation of the landscape during those years, what is involved in re-purposing a former solid waste disposal facility of this scale into publicly accessible recreational space; current activities and visions for the future.The first stop will be the site of Mierle Laderman Ukelesâ€™ Percent for Art project for the future Freshkills South Park entitled Landing. Upon completion it will have  three components: the soaring, cantilevered Overlook and the two earthworks, Earth Bench and Earth Triangle. These three components will be connected by the newly graded and ADA-accessible landbridge whichâ€“ at nearly 500 feet long and some 32 feet above the tidal inlet belowâ€“connects the two mounds that form South Park (a combined 147 acres).  This will be followed by visits to adjacent viewing areas to get different perspectives of the Landing site and appreciate the larger context of Ukelesâ€™s experiential art: framed by the cityâ€™s â€˜landfill to landscapeâ€ù master plan, the site reveals the contradictions and unity of â€œman-made natureâ€ù and â€œman-made urbanism.""Meeting Point: Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Staten Island side; Ramp E/ Taxi stand. You should be able to take the 11am ferry and join us at the bus by 11:30am.Logistics: There will be a rest room stop. However, participants should bring their own nourishment (there will be no stops for food), dress warmly and wear sturdy shoes or boots. All visitors are required to sign waivers before entering the site.Photo Credit: Rendering of Mierle Laderman Ukeles' LandingThis event is made possible with support from the NYC Department of Sanitation and NYC Parks."

A Maintenance PerspectiveTo accompany the current exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents a special convening that explores the NYC Department of Sanitationâ€™s ambitious 0x30 initiative to radically rework the Cityâ€™s garbage and recycling infrastructure. The convening features the perspective of voices that are rarely heard from but are critical to the success of this initiative: residential building supers.There will be brief presentations by Larissa Harris of the Queens Museum, NYC Department of Sanitationâ€™s (DSNY) Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, Anthropologist in Residence Robin Nagle, and Artist in Residence, Mierle Laderman-Ukeles explaining the critical role maintenance work plays in achieving 0x30.Additionally, we will witness a conversation between residential building maintenance staff to see how managing waste will maximize diversion in the cityâ€™s residential buildings.DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, â€œWhile many people view us, while the sanitation workers are out doing their job, they donâ€™t actually see us. This is also true for the maintenance workers handling waste within the cityâ€™s buildings before it gets to the curb. This conversation is an opportunity to bring to light a behind the scenes maintenance perspective for New Yorkers. It is an honor to be able to work with the Queens Museum on such an innovative exchange of ideas.â€ùThe special discussion will take place around Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for Ukelesâ€™s installation Unburning Freedom Hall.

As part of this exhibit, please join the artists and curators of Chance Ecologies on Sunday October 23rd for a public symposium, composed of film screenings, artist talks, and a facilitated public discussion about the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies. The Chance Ecologies Symposium will take place inside the theatre of the Queens Museum, and in the Community Partnership Gallery.12-1:30pm: Chance Ecologies in MotionA screening of new video works by Joianne Bittle, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Dylan Gauthier, Nathan Kensinger, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, and Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)Over the past two summers, the artists of Chance Ecologies have engaged with three different sites in Queens: Hunterâ€™s Point South, the Newtown Creek and the Flushing River. The works in this screening present a wide range of responses to these post-industrial sites, ranging from collaborative performances to solitary explorations, and employ a variety of film techniques, including stop motion animation, underwater recordings, and drone footage. Each of these films is a unique creation inspired by a different aspect of these landscapes, and when viewed together, they present a larger picture of the ideas informing Chance Ecologies. The screening will be following by a Q&A with the artists. Please click here for more information on the screenings: http://www.queensmuseum.org/2016/10/chance-ecologies-in-motion1:30â€”2pm: Chance Ecologies on ViewGallery walk and refreshmentsThe curators of Chance Ecologies will lead a walk-through of Chance Ecologies: Queens, the current exhibit in the Queens Museum Community Partnerships Gallery, giving an overview of the ideas behind Chance Ecologies. Several artists, include Kristyna and Marek Milde, Marisa Tesauro, and Joianne Bittle, will be present to give details about their individual works. Light refreshments will be provided.2â€”3:30pm: Creatively Engaging Chance EcologiesArtist talks by Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson WrightChance Ecologies: Queens includes a variety of creative approaches to engaging with flora and fauna found in post-industrial urban wildernesses. These artist talks will take a deeper look into three different approaches to the landscape, from walking to seed collecting to virtual reality.Coyote Walk ProjectDillon de Give will speak about the Coyote Walk Itinerancy, a short walking residency which he has been leading annually for 8 years. Originally inspired by Hal, a wild coyote that appeared in New York City in 2006, the project examines and traces greenspace channels running through NYC and surrounding wilds. This talk will begin in the Community Partnerships Gallery, move to the Panorama of New York City, and end in the Queens Museum theater.Vegetative Resistance: Weeds and Wildness in Human Dominated LandscapesEllie Irons works with cosmopolitan spontaneous plants that thrive in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. Often described as weeds, they provide a starting point for exploring nativeness, invasion, gentrification and the future of land use in the face of global climate change. As we concern ourselves with big questions of globalization, mass extinction, and climate change, we exert control in small ways by attempting to restore or cultivate landscape fragments to mimic historical ideals. As we pour resources into such measures, what are we losing, erasing, eradicating? Expanding from these questions, Irons will explore the tale of one particular weedy species: Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis), while raising questions about human and vegetative agency in the so-called Anthropocene.Hidden Vistas: Empathy and Place in Virtual Reality InstallationsWhat does it mean to have empathy for a place? How can we use cutting edge technologies such as virtual reality and 360Â° video to immerse a viewer in places that no longer exist? That are too difficult to find? Too hazardous to visit? Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright share their creative process of applying â€œthe empathy machineâ€ù to wild geographies.3:30â€”4:30pm: Digging into Chance EcologiesA public discussion led by the curators of Chance Ecologies and Daniel CampoThe closing event of this daylong symposium will open up a larger conversation amongst the artists and participants of Chance Ecologies, lead by co-curators Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger and by Daniel Campo, author of â€œThe Accidental Playground.â€ù This discussion will consider the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies: What is the importance of unplanned green spaces? What types of ecologies can thrive in liminal, post-industrial landscapes, and why? How can we responsibly interact with and advocate for these spaces? What is the role of artists and creativity and community in these spaces? How can chance ecological landscapes becomes sites of new relational structures between humans, the environment and other species? What will happen to these spaces in the future, as the city faces challenges caused by rising sea levels and climate change?Image by Nathan Kensinger"

Social disintegration and existential desperation can be sources of life and creative energy. Our first hit rappers know something that Hegel said modern men and women had to learn: they know how to â€œlook the negative in the face and live with it.â€ù They have looked the ruins in the face, and they have lived with them, and they have come through. Now they can see and feel their way to new life.  â€“ Marshall Berman â€œNew York City: Seeing Through the Ruinsâ€ùArtist and activist Shellyne Rodriguez will be hosting a panel discussion that aims to trace back the peopleâ€™s ongoing fight to remain in the Bronx. The event will cover the era of the slumlord fires, the subsequent redevelopment, as well as the most recent efforts to gentrify the Bronx via luxury developments, including an attempted renaming of the South Bronx and the art-washing that is plaguing major cities throughout the globe. Longtime tenants who survived the fires will give testimonials and veteran activists from Nos Quedamos, Mothers on the Move, and Take Back the Bronx will provide a historical context for the battle of the Bronx now raging between the community, developers, and the artists caught in between.This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, complementing the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiroâ€™s Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016.

This exhibit brings together creative works from a large group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists, who have explored three of these sites around the borough over the past two years: Hunterâ€™s Point South, the Newtown Creek, and the Flushing River. Each of these places has its own unique history and landscape, but all three are united by a shared legacy of industrial pollution and human intervention.Over the centuries, the Queens waterfront has been reshaped by successive waves of development and redevelopment, creating an entirely new urban coastline. Once a series of natural ecosystems, lined with streams and rivers, wetlands and forests, the shoreline is now home to power plants, highways, landfills, and new residential and commercial developments. However, several sections of this man-made waterfront have been temporarily reclaimed by nature, hovering between waves of development and real estate speculation, and have become unplanned green spaces. These unmanaged meadows, glens and marshes support a diversity of life not found in the cityâ€™s official parks, providing an important habitat for wild species of birds, insects, trees and flowers, and upending our assumptions of human dominance in the city.Chance Ecologies: Queens opens up the complex dialogues about the importance of these spaces by inviting artists and community members to creatively engage with them, both in the museum and in person. The artistsâ€™ of Chance Ecologies extensive, ongoing research and fieldwork explores the varieties of life found in these sites, while also articulating a deeper understanding of how the environment has been and continues to be radically reshaped by human impacts, including globalization and climate change. By bringing members of the public to these remote areas, to creatively engage with these artistic responses, Chance Ecologies celebrates the resilience of urban nature, and asks community members to consider their own place in the larger sphere of life.Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a diverse array of artworks, from video installation and new media to sculpture and drawing, the results of collaborations between archaeologists, architects, filmmakers, urbanists and naturalists with community members of all ages and backgrounds. To expand the dialogue around this exhibit, Chance Ecologies will present a day of participatory art projects and public performances along the Flushing River on October 16th, and a symposium of authors, artists, academics and community groups at the museum on October 23rd. More information on those events will be announced at the Queens Museum website.Chance Ecologies: Queens is curated by artists Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger, and includes work by many of the artists and thinkers who have been a part of Chance Ecologies, including Joianne Bittle, Daniel Campo, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Edrex Fontanilla, Dylan Gauthier, Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Chris Kennedy, Kristyna Milde, Marek Milde, Anne Percoco, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit), Raphaele Shirley, Marisa Tesauro, and Sarah Nelson Wright.Chance Ecologies was created in 2015 by Catherine Grau, Nathan Kensinger and Stephen Zacks, and has been supported by the Queens Museum, ArtBuilt Mobile Studios and the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation with a residency at the Studio In The Park program, and has worked in partnership with Amplifier Inc., RadiatorArts, and the Newtown Creek Alliance.

Duration 90mins.Free, but RSVP required to preddy@queensmuseum.orgAbout our Guide:About the Co-presenter:Julien A.Terrell was born, raised and currently lives in the West Harlem neighborhood where he first developed his interest in community and cultural organizing. His social justice work began in Buffalo working with local residents and activists to organize for the clean-up of Brownfield sites in low income communities of color and creating processes based in self determination and creative visioning.Shortly after returning back to New York City in 2007, he started focusing on gentrification, environmental justice issues and looking at how creative planning principles can be used to preserve communal and cultural spaces that provide opportunities for inter-generational learning. In 2013 after working on solidarity projects in Cuba and Brazil, his commitment to developing youth leadership both locally and internationally motivated him to join The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, working until 2016, with young people to end police control in Harlem. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is a holistic youth development organization located in West Harlem dedicated to long term development of young people of color as long term critically thinking leaders. He continues to organize and work on community based art projects as part of the Harlem Copwatch Team and is the founder of the Renaissance Chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation.The Laundromat Project (LP) amplifies the creativity that already exists within communities by using arts and culture to build community networks, solve problems, and enhance our sense of ownership in the places where we live, work, and grow. LP envisions a world in which artists are understood as valuable assets in every community and everyday people know the power of their own creative capacity to transform their lives, their relationships, and their surroundings.

West Queens,Queens,1.0734E+15,Artists In/Of The City,ART_EVENT,2016-09-25T13:00:00-0400,"A National Convening Around the Peace TableTo accompany the exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents Artists In/Of The City, a special convening that explores the current wave of new artist residency programs in city agencies taking place throughout the nation.Beyond Mierle Laderman Ukelesâ€™ almost four decade long artist residency within the NYC Department of Sanitation, NYCâ€™s Department of Cultural Affairs has recently initiated artist residencies inside three other city agencies and is working on more. Cities around the country, including Boston, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, are experimenting with their own versions of residencies within municipal agencies and departments.Artists In/Of The City convening provides an open space to share and discuss the aspirations and experiences of artists and their city agency partners involved in these kinds of residencies in NYC and across the country. Weâ€™ve also invited those in charge of organizing these residencies to share how they initiated and structured their residencies given their local contexts. We hope that these examples will illuminate the best ways moving forward to harness artistsâ€™ unique creative and critical contributions to how urban systems work.The Artists In/Of The City convening starts with a brief examination by Ukeles of the artworks that inspired the event from the Touch Sanitation Show, 1984. Three works originally conceived for Touch Sanitation Show have been reimagined for the Queens Museum, and we will meet in front of One Yearâ€™s Worktime II, 1984/2016, a full year of work shifts in the form of clock faces has been silkscreened over a gradient of colors representing the seasons which is installed on the Museumâ€™s Large Wall in the Main Atrium. We will then assemble around the Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for Ukelesâ€™s installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it will be suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.This setting for the convening, a literal round table, has inspired a format for the convening consisting of three concentric rings of guests. The first ring will be Presenters, artists and city officials with direct experience with residences at municipal agencies whose presentations will act as conversation starters for the convening. The second ring will be Respondents, other artists who have been asked to prepare questions to bring to the table that can deepen the conversation. The third ring will be Participants, other invited artists and the general public interested in the theme that can keep the conversation going with their own questions and comments during the convening.Moderated by Queens Museum Director Laura Raicovich.Confirmed guests for the convening include:- Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Sanitation- Vito Turso, Deputy Commissioner of Public Information at NYC Department of Sanitation- Norman Steisel, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Brendan Sexton, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Tom Finkelpearl, Commissioner of NYC Department of Cultural Affairs- Tania Bruguera, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Mayorâ€™s Office of Immigrant Affairs- Nisha Agarwal, NYC Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs- Latisha Russaw & Ellen Greeley, Department of Veterans' Services- Jules Rochielle, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteranâ€™s Services- Christine Tinsley, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteranâ€™s Services- Gladys Carrion, Commissioner of NYC Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services- The Lost Collective, Artists-in-Residence at NYC Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services- Marcus Young, former City Artist, City of St Paul, MN- Alan Nakagawa, Artists-in-Residence at Los Angeles Department of Transportation- Julie Burros, Chief of Arts and Culture, City of Boston- Gulgun Kayim, Chief of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy, City of MinneapolisImage: Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Touch Sanitation Performance, 1979-1980.

Ukeles is undoubtedly best-known for her 38+ year role as the official, unsalaried Artist-in-Residence at New Yorkâ€™s Department of Sanitation.

West Queens,Queens,1.24186E+15,Offsite: Our World of Difference: Celebrating Flushingâ€™s Pluralism,LECTURE,2016-08-28T15:50:00-0400,"A Nonstop Metropolis Walking Tour with Garnette Cadogan and R. Scott Hanson.Please note the date/time is now Sunday, August 28 from 3:50-6pm.â€œBlock after block, I keep trying to search for what lies beyond. Beyond my own neighborhood, beyond my awareness, beyond my self. I am searching for what the cityâ€™s immigrant communities hold forth and hold back, recognizing that, as Alfred Kazin once said of lights along Jamaica Avenue, â€˜they were searching out so many new things in meâ€™.â€ùâ€”Garnette Cadogan, Round and RoundThis event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiroâ€™s Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas  at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016. Garnette Cadoganâ€™s essay Round and Round is a jumping off point for the map City of Walkers: Around the World in a Day by cartographer Molly Roy; both found in Nonstop Metropolis.  One spring afternoon in 2015, Cadogan set out from his home in the Bronx to take a twenty-four-hour walk around the city. Guided by the idea that the city is inexhaustible and its stories countless, he saw no end to his searchâ€”or our searching. And so he decided that a circular route was only fitting for New York, a place where mystery.Diversity is central to New York Cityâ€™s lifeblood: the cityâ€™s mix of people and perspectives and neighborhoods are its pulse and increase its vibrancy. And few neighborhoods demonstrate that as vividly as Flushing, Queens,  home to many vibrant immigrant communities. Flushing displays the cityâ€™s diversity, but also demonstrates the power and resonance of its tolerance. What are the challenges of pluralismâ€”how we live together in spite of our differencesâ€”and what are its joys?Join us on a walk with Garnette Cadogan, editor-at-large for Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas and visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture to explore Flushing â€“ its history and impact in the story of pluralism â€“ then disperse to enjoy the manifold culinary delights of the neighborhood. He will be joined by R. Scott Hanson Ph.D., author of City of Gods: Religious Freedom, Immigration, and Pluralism in Flushing, Queens (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016).A free copy of a printed broadside with the map and abridged version of the essay will be provided to all attendees.  You can also check out Cadoganâ€™s essay Walking While Black in advance of the walk: http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/Meeting Point: St. Georgeâ€™s Church, 135-32 38th Ave, Flushing, NY 11354, on Main Street a few minutes north of no. 7 subway and LIRR Flushing stations.Meet at 3:50 to start walk at 4pm. Free, RSVP requested but not required to: preddy@queensmuseum.orgThis event also draws on the map of Flushing and its traditions of pluralism in Nonstop Metropolis, Planting Liberty, whose concept was by Emmy Catedral."

The Wild Within is an experiment in seeing each other, inspired by the following quote:â€œSince that day, when I close my eyes I can see the pupils of the two rust-colored coyotes. There was something secret there, a wildness that didnâ€™t belong to the coyote but that I recognized as my fundamental nature. It was who I was but it didnâ€™t belong to me. It was the intelligence of all beings. It was uncultivated, unbiased, and unconditioned. It was true intelligence.â€ù â€“ Paul Rezendes, The Wild WithinImpossible Bridge / Edmund Mooney + Dylan Gauthier3pm-5pmA collaboration between artists Edmund Mooney and Dylan Gauthier, Impossible Bridge is a performance and floating sound sculpture that utilizes a hand-built boat and two hydrophones to create an underwater audio bridge to span the long-disused creek crossing at Plank Road.Seed Collecting Walk / Ellie Irons and Anne Percoco4pm and 5:30pmA walk along the wild-growing banks of the Newtown Creek, to identify and gather seeds from the hardy plants that are thriving on the banks of this super-funded waterway.

Participants will learn about the history of the site and gain the perspectives of the Sanitation and Parks Departments on the transformation of the landscape during those years, what is involved in re-purposing a former solid waste disposal facility of this scale into publicly accessible recreational space; current activities and visions for the future.The first stop will be the site of Mierle Laderman Ukelesâ€™ Percent for Art project for the future Freshkills South Park entitled Landing. Upon completion it will have  three components: the soaring, cantilevered Overlook and the two earthworks, Earth Bench and Earth Triangle. These three components will be connected by the newly graded and ADA-accessible landbridge whichâ€“ at nearly 500 feet long and some 32 feet above the tidal inlet belowâ€“connects the two mounds that form South Park (a combined 147 acres).  This will be followed by visits to adjacent viewing areas to get different perspectives of the Landing site and appreciate the larger context of Ukelesâ€™s experiential art: framed by the cityâ€™s â€˜landfill to landscapeâ€ù master plan, the site reveals the contradictions and unity of â€œman-made natureâ€ù and â€œman-made urbanism.""Meeting Point: Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Staten Island side; Ramp E/ Taxi stand. You should be able to take the 11am ferry and join us at the bus by 11:30am.Logistics: There will be a rest room stop.

A Maintenance PerspectiveTo accompany the current exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents a special convening that explores the NYC Department of Sanitationâ€™s ambitious 0x30 initiative to radically rework the Cityâ€™s garbage and recycling infrastructure. The convening features the perspective of voices that are rarely heard from but are critical to the success of this initiative: residential building supers.There will be brief presentations by Larissa Harris of the Queens Museum, NYC Department of Sanitationâ€™s (DSNY) Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, Anthropologist in Residence Robin Nagle, and Artist in Residence, Mierle Laderman-Ukeles explaining the critical role maintenance work plays in achieving 0x30.Additionally, we will witness a conversation between residential building maintenance staff to see how managing waste will maximize diversion in the cityâ€™s residential buildings.DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, â€œWhile many people view us, while the sanitation workers are out doing their job, they donâ€™t actually see us. This is also true for the maintenance workers handling waste within the cityâ€™s buildings before it gets to the curb. This conversation is an opportunity to bring to light a behind the scenes maintenance perspective for New Yorkers. It is an honor to be able to work with the Queens Museum on such an innovative exchange of ideas.â€ùThe special discussion will take place around Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for Ukelesâ€™s installation Unburning Freedom Hall.

West Queens,Queens,1.85801E+14,Chance Ecologies: Queens Public Symposium,ART_EVENT,2016-10-23T12:00:00-0400,"Chance Ecologies: Queens is an exhibit of new works, artistic gestures and research projects engaging with the undesigned and wild growing landscapes found in post-industrial sites, landfills and other liminal spaces around Queens, which will be on view at the Queens Museumâ€™s Community Partnerships Gallery from October 8th to 30th. As part of this exhibit, please join the artists and curators of Chance Ecologies on Sunday October 23rd for a public symposium, composed of film screenings, artist talks, and a facilitated public discussion about the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies. The Chance Ecologies Symposium will take place inside the theatre of the Queens Museum, and in the Community Partnership Gallery.12-1:30pm: Chance Ecologies in MotionA screening of new video works by Joianne Bittle, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Dylan Gauthier, Nathan Kensinger, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, and Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)Over the past two summers, the artists of Chance Ecologies have engaged with three different sites in Queens: Hunterâ€™s Point South, the Newtown Creek and the Flushing River. The works in this screening present a wide range of responses to these post-industrial sites, ranging from collaborative performances to solitary explorations, and employ a variety of film techniques, including stop motion animation, underwater recordings, and drone footage. Each of these films is a unique creation inspired by a different aspect of these landscapes, and when viewed together, they present a larger picture of the ideas informing Chance Ecologies. The screening will be following by a Q&A with the artists. Please click here for more information on the screenings: http://www.queensmuseum.org/2016/10/chance-ecologies-in-motion1:30â€”2pm: Chance Ecologies on ViewGallery walk and refreshmentsThe curators of Chance Ecologies will lead a walk-through of Chance Ecologies: Queens, the current exhibit in the Queens Museum Community Partnerships Gallery, giving an overview of the ideas behind Chance Ecologies. Several artists, include Kristyna and Marek Milde, Marisa Tesauro, and Joianne Bittle, will be present to give details about their individual works. Light refreshments will be provided.2â€”3:30pm: Creatively Engaging Chance EcologiesArtist talks by Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson WrightChance Ecologies: Queens includes a variety of creative approaches to engaging with flora and fauna found in post-industrial urban wildernesses. These artist talks will take a deeper look into three different approaches to the landscape, from walking to seed collecting to virtual reality.Coyote Walk ProjectDillon de Give will speak about the Coyote Walk Itinerancy, a short walking residency which he has been leading annually for 8 years. Originally inspired by Hal, a wild coyote that appeared in New York City in 2006, the project examines and traces greenspace channels running through NYC and surrounding wilds. This talk will begin in the Community Partnerships Gallery, move to the Panorama of New York City, and end in the Queens Museum theater.Vegetative Resistance: Weeds and Wildness in Human Dominated LandscapesEllie Irons works with cosmopolitan spontaneous plants that thrive in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. Often described as weeds, they provide a starting point for exploring nativeness, invasion, gentrification and the future of land use in the face of global climate change. As we concern ourselves with big questions of globalization, mass extinction, and climate change, we exert control in small ways by attempting to restore or cultivate landscape fragments to mimic historical ideals. As we pour resources into such measures, what are we losing, erasing, eradicating? Expanding from these questions, Irons will explore the tale of one particular weedy species: Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis), while raising questions about human and vegetative agency in the so-called Anthropocene.Hidden Vistas: Empathy and Place in Virtual Reality InstallationsWhat does it mean to have empathy for a place? How can we use cutting edge technologies such as virtual reality and 360Â° video to immerse a viewer in places that no longer exist? That are too difficult to find? Too hazardous to visit?

What types of ecologies can thrive in liminal, post-industrial landscapes, and why? How can we responsibly interact with and advocate for these spaces? What is the role of artists and creativity and community in these spaces? How can chance ecological landscapes becomes sites of new relational structures between humans, the environment and other species? What will happen to these spaces in the future, as the city faces challenges caused by rising sea levels and climate change?Image by Nathan Kensinger"

Social disintegration and existential desperation can be sources of life and creative energy. Our first hit rappers know something that Hegel said modern men and women had to learn: they know how to â€œlook the negative in the face and live with it.â€ù They have looked the ruins in the face, and they have lived with them, and they have come through. Now they can see and feel their way to new life.  â€“ Marshall Berman â€œNew York City: Seeing Through the Ruinsâ€ùArtist and activist Shellyne Rodriguez will be hosting a panel discussion that aims to trace back the peopleâ€™s ongoing fight to remain in the Bronx. The event will cover the era of the slumlord fires, the subsequent redevelopment, as well as the most recent efforts to gentrify the Bronx via luxury developments, including an attempted renaming of the South Bronx and the art-washing that is plaguing major cities throughout the globe. Longtime tenants who survived the fires will give testimonials and veteran activists from Nos Quedamos, Mothers on the Move, and Take Back the Bronx will provide a historical context for the battle of the Bronx now raging between the community, developers, and the artists caught in between.This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, complementing the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiroâ€™s Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016.

This exhibit brings together creative works from a large group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists, who have explored three of these sites around the borough over the past two years: Hunterâ€™s Point South, the Newtown Creek, and the Flushing River. Each of these places has its own unique history and landscape, but all three are united by a shared legacy of industrial pollution and human intervention.Over the centuries, the Queens waterfront has been reshaped by successive waves of development and redevelopment, creating an entirely new urban coastline. Once a series of natural ecosystems, lined with streams and rivers, wetlands and forests, the shoreline is now home to power plants, highways, landfills, and new residential and commercial developments. However, several sections of this man-made waterfront have been temporarily reclaimed by nature, hovering between waves of development and real estate speculation, and have become unplanned green spaces. These unmanaged meadows, glens and marshes support a diversity of life not found in the cityâ€™s official parks, providing an important habitat for wild species of birds, insects, trees and flowers, and upending our assumptions of human dominance in the city.Chance Ecologies: Queens opens up the complex dialogues about the importance of these spaces by inviting artists and community members to creatively engage with them, both in the museum and in person. The artistsâ€™ of Chance Ecologies extensive, ongoing research and fieldwork explores the varieties of life found in these sites, while also articulating a deeper understanding of how the environment has been and continues to be radically reshaped by human impacts, including globalization and climate change. By bringing members of the public to these remote areas, to creatively engage with these artistic responses, Chance Ecologies celebrates the resilience of urban nature, and asks community members to consider their own place in the larger sphere of life.Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a diverse array of artworks, from video installation and new media to sculpture and drawing, the results of collaborations between archaeologists, architects, filmmakers, urbanists and naturalists with community members of all ages and backgrounds. To expand the dialogue around this exhibit, Chance Ecologies will present a day of participatory art projects and public performances along the Flushing River on October 16th, and a symposium of authors, artists, academics and community groups at the museum on October 23rd. More information on those events will be announced at the Queens Museum website.Chance Ecologies: Queens is curated by artists Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger, and includes work by many of the artists and thinkers who have been a part of Chance Ecologies, including Joianne Bittle, Daniel Campo, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Edrex Fontanilla, Dylan Gauthier, Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Chris Kennedy, Kristyna Milde, Marek Milde, Anne Percoco, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit), Raphaele Shirley, Marisa Tesauro, and Sarah Nelson Wright.Chance Ecologies was created in 2015 by Catherine Grau, Nathan Kensinger and Stephen Zacks, and has been supported by the Queens Museum, ArtBuilt Mobile Studios and the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation with a residency at the Studio In The Park program, and has worked in partnership with Amplifier Inc., RadiatorArts, and the Newtown Creek Alliance.

Terrell,  will lead an interactive walk focusing on Harlemâ€™s past as a local and international hub for political strategy and creative action. Sites will include Hotel Teresa, Lenox Lounge, Malcolm X Outreach Corner, and more.

Duration 90mins.Free, but RSVP required to preddy@queensmuseum.orgAbout our Guide:About the Co-presenter:Julien A.Terrell was born, raised and currently lives in the West Harlem neighborhood where he first developed his interest in community and cultural organizing. His social justice work began in Buffalo working with local residents and activists to organize for the clean-up of Brownfield sites in low income communities of color and creating processes based in self determination and creative visioning.Shortly after returning back to New York City in 2007, he started focusing on gentrification, environmental justice issues and looking at how creative planning principles can be used to preserve communal and cultural spaces that provide opportunities for inter-generational learning. In 2013 after working on solidarity projects in Cuba and Brazil, his commitment to developing youth leadership both locally and internationally motivated him to join The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, working until 2016, with young people to end police control in Harlem. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is a holistic youth development organization located in West Harlem dedicated to long term development of young people of color as long term critically thinking leaders. He continues to organize and work on community based art projects as part of the Harlem Copwatch Team and is the founder of the Renaissance Chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation.The Laundromat Project (LP) amplifies the creativity that already exists within communities by using arts and culture to build community networks, solve problems, and enhance our sense of ownership in the places where we live, work, and grow. LP envisions a world in which artists are understood as valuable assets in every community and everyday people know the power of their own creative capacity to transform their lives, their relationships, and their surroundings.

West Queens,Queens,1.0734E+15,Artists In/Of The City,ART_EVENT,2016-09-25T13:00:00-0400,"A National Convening Around the Peace TableTo accompany the exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents Artists In/Of The City, a special convening that explores the current wave of new artist residency programs in city agencies taking place throughout the nation.Beyond Mierle Laderman Ukelesâ€™ almost four decade long artist residency within the NYC Department of Sanitation, NYCâ€™s Department of Cultural Affairs has recently initiated artist residencies inside three other city agencies and is working on more. Cities around the country, including Boston, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, are experimenting with their own versions of residencies within municipal agencies and departments.Artists In/Of The City convening provides an open space to share and discuss the aspirations and experiences of artists and their city agency partners involved in these kinds of residencies in NYC and across the country. Weâ€™ve also invited those in charge of organizing these residencies to share how they initiated and structured their residencies given their local contexts. We hope that these examples will illuminate the best ways moving forward to harness artistsâ€™ unique creative and critical contributions to how urban systems work.The Artists In/Of The City convening starts with a brief examination by Ukeles of the artworks that inspired the event from the Touch Sanitation Show, 1984. Three works originally conceived for Touch Sanitation Show have been reimagined for the Queens Museum, and we will meet in front of One Yearâ€™s Worktime II, 1984/2016, a full year of work shifts in the form of clock faces has been silkscreened over a gradient of colors representing the seasons which is installed on the Museumâ€™s Large Wall in the Main Atrium. We will then assemble around the Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for Ukelesâ€™s installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it will be suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.This setting for the convening, a literal round table, has inspired a format for the convening consisting of three concentric rings of guests. The first ring will be Presenters, artists and city officials with direct experience with residences at municipal agencies whose presentations will act as conversation starters for the convening. The second ring will be Respondents, other artists who have been asked to prepare questions to bring to the table that can deepen the conversation. The third ring will be Participants, other invited artists and the general public interested in the theme that can keep the conversation going with their own questions and comments during the convening.Moderated by Queens Museum Director Laura Raicovich.Confirmed guests for the convening include:- Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Sanitation- Vito Turso, Deputy Commissioner of Public Information at NYC Department of Sanitation- Norman Steisel, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Brendan Sexton, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Tom Finkelpearl, Commissioner of NYC Department of Cultural Affairs- Tania Bruguera, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Mayorâ€™s Office of Immigrant Affairs- Nisha Agarwal, NYC Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs- Latisha Russaw & Ellen Greeley, Department of Veterans' Services- Jules Rochielle, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteranâ€™s Services- Christine Tinsley, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteranâ€™s Services- Gladys Carrion, Commissioner of NYC Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services- The Lost Collective, Artists-in-Residence at NYC Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services- Marcus Young, former City Artist, City of St Paul, MN- Alan Nakagawa, Artists-in-Residence at Los Angeles Department of Transportation- Julie Burros, Chief of Arts and Culture, City of Boston- Gulgun Kayim, Chief of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy, City of MinneapolisImage: Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Touch Sanitation Performance, 1979-1980.

West Queens,Queens,1.24186E+15,Offsite: Our World of Difference: Celebrating Flushingâ€™s Pluralism,LECTURE,2016-08-28T15:50:00-0400,"A Nonstop Metropolis Walking Tour with Garnette Cadogan and R. Scott Hanson.Please note the date/time is now Sunday, August 28 from 3:50-6pm.â€œBlock after block, I keep trying to search for what lies beyond. Beyond my own neighborhood, beyond my awareness, beyond my self. I am searching for what the cityâ€™s immigrant communities hold forth and hold back, recognizing that, as Alfred Kazin once said of lights along Jamaica Avenue, â€˜they were searching out so many new things in meâ€™.â€ùâ€”Garnette Cadogan, Round and RoundThis event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiroâ€™s Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas  at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016. Garnette Cadoganâ€™s essay Round and Round is a jumping off point for the map City of Walkers: Around the World in a Day by cartographer Molly Roy; both found in Nonstop Metropolis.  One spring afternoon in 2015, Cadogan set out from his home in the Bronx to take a twenty-four-hour walk around the city. Guided by the idea that the city is inexhaustible and its stories countless, he saw no end to his searchâ€”or our searching. And so he decided that a circular route was only fitting for New York, a place where mystery.Diversity is central to New York Cityâ€™s lifeblood: the cityâ€™s mix of people and perspectives and neighborhoods are its pulse and increase its vibrancy. And few neighborhoods demonstrate that as vividly as Flushing, Queens,  home to many vibrant immigrant communities. Flushing displays the cityâ€™s diversity, but also demonstrates the power and resonance of its tolerance. What are the challenges of pluralismâ€”how we live together in spite of our differencesâ€”and what are its joys?Join us on a walk with Garnette Cadogan, editor-at-large for Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas and visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture to explore Flushing â€“ its history and impact in the story of pluralism â€“ then disperse to enjoy the manifold culinary delights of the neighborhood. He will be joined by R. Scott Hanson Ph.D., author of City of Gods: Religious Freedom, Immigration, and Pluralism in Flushing, Queens (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016).A free copy of a printed broadside with the map and abridged version of the essay will be provided to all attendees.  You can also check out Cadoganâ€™s essay Walking While Black in advance of the walk: http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/Meeting Point: St. Georgeâ€™s Church, 135-32 38th Ave, Flushing, NY 11354, on Main Street a few minutes north of no. 7 subway and LIRR Flushing stations.Meet at 3:50 to start walk at 4pm. Free, RSVP requested but not required to: preddy@queensmuseum.orgThis event also draws on the map of Flushing and its traditions of pluralism in Nonstop Metropolis, Planting Liberty, whose concept was by Emmy Catedral."

Rebecca Solnitâ€™s essay The Oysters In The Spire is a jumping off point for the map Wildlife by cartographer Molly Roy and artist Tino Rodriguez; both found in Nonstop Metropolis. The curators of Chance Ecologies have created a daylong event inspired by this essay and map.The public is invited to join an international group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists from Chance Ecologies at a series of participatory actions and workshops in the wilderness along the banks of the Newtown Creek, one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States.

Participants will interact with a diverse range of species living in and along the creek, and with unique arts projects being developed on its shoreline by Chance Ecologies, a curatorial framework for artistic practices exploring unplanned, post-industrial wild spaces.This day of activities will take place at the Plank Road project site, one of the only access points to the unplanned shoreline of the Newtown Creek, and is being presented in partnership with the Newtown Creek Alliance.

A field guide to local birds will be distributed, for visitors to seek their own inspiration onsite.Virtual Reality, Empathy, and Place / Edrex Fontanilla1:30pm to 4pmNew media artist Edrex Fontanilla will bring individual visitors into an immersive experience of the lost wilderness of Hunterâ€™s Point South, allowing participants to exist in a place that no longer exists.

The Wild Within is an experiment in seeing each other, inspired by the following quote:â€œSince that day, when I close my eyes I can see the pupils of the two rust-colored coyotes. There was something secret there, a wildness that didnâ€™t belong to the coyote but that I recognized as my fundamental nature. It was who I was but it didnâ€™t belong to me. It was the intelligence of all beings. It was uncultivated, unbiased, and unconditioned. It was true intelligence.â€ù â€“ Paul Rezendes, The Wild WithinImpossible Bridge / Edmund Mooney + Dylan Gauthier3pm-5pmA collaboration between artists Edmund Mooney and Dylan Gauthier, Impossible Bridge is a performance and floating sound sculpture that utilizes a hand-built boat and two hydrophones to create an underwater audio bridge to span the long-disused creek crossing at Plank Road.Seed Collecting Walk / Ellie Irons and Anne Percoco4pm and 5:30pmA walk along the wild-growing banks of the Newtown Creek, to identify and gather seeds from the hardy plants that are thriving on the banks of this super-funded waterway. Collected seeds will become part of the Next Epoch Seed Library, an art installation which provides a diverse gene pool of weedy species, well-situated to face the Anthropocene era.Undomesticated Species, Blindness & Bliss / Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)6-7pmAs part of an ongoing film project at Plank Road, artist Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit) will arrange a sound performance by artist Tamio Shiraishi, based on the underlying script of her project.

Oddo will host a mobile mammography van outside of Borough Hall on Thursday, May 8, 2014, beginning at 9am. The screenings will be available to women ages 40 and older who have not had a mammogram in the past year.â€œWomen need to be made aware of risk factors and see a doctor â€“ they need to take care of themselves too, so they can be there for their families,â€ù noted Marion Smith, RN, Cancer Program Coordinator at Richmond University Medical Center.  Mammograms are still the best way to detect changes and disease, Island experts agree. â€œMammograms are important preventative measures for women. The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,â€ù noted Borough President Oddo. â€œBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.â€ùIn addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  â€œAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,â€ù noted Ms. Smith. â€œWomen are afraid, they donâ€™t want to know.â€ùBut knowing is exactly what can save their lives.The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.In addition, a mini-womenâ€™s health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the Mayorâ€™s Office to Combat Domestic Violence.All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening."

Oddo will host a mobile mammography van outside of Borough Hall on Thursday, May 8, 2014, beginning at 9am. The screenings will be available to women ages 40 and older who have not had a mammogram in the past year.â€œWomen need to be made aware of risk factors and see a doctor â€“ they need to take care of themselves too, so they can be there for their families,â€ù noted Marion Smith, RN, Cancer Program Coordinator at Richmond University Medical Center.  Mammograms are still the best way to detect changes and disease, Island experts agree. â€œMammograms are important preventative measures for women. The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,â€ù noted Borough President Oddo. â€œBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.â€ùIn addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  â€œAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,â€ù noted Ms. Smith. â€œWomen are afraid, they donâ€™t want to know.â€ùBut knowing is exactly what can save their lives.The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.In addition, a mini-womenâ€™s health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the Mayorâ€™s Office to Combat Domestic Violence.All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening."
