To honor the anonymity of survivors who wish to remain unidentified and to support those who have the courage to be named. To unite the stories and experiences of survivors and show that our voices are varied and many. To help heal by revealing that every story has a place. To challenge the myths surrounding sexual assault and rape in our communities. To support each other by acknowledging that every experience is unique as well as connected. To invite the public into discourse about the stigmas, myths, and realities surrounding rape in our culture. To encourage government officials and law enforcement to treat survivors of sexual assault and rape with respect and compassion, to view sexual assault and rape as serious offenses worth seeking justice for, and to end the backlog. To end the stigma and silence. To provide much needed funding for regional crisis centers, hotlines, and victim support services through the acceptance of donations for works of art and performances. To suggest that offering a voice to the unspoken realities of our present is the first step to defining a better future.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Art-Against-Assault/516293238416681"

This is Kindermusik, the most trusted music and movement program for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and young children.Our program is based on research demonstrating the benefits of music at each stage of a child's development. We start from where your child is, regardless of his age, and provide activities that stimulate his mind, body, and sense of play. Research shows that music improves a childâ€™s memory, cognitive development, learning skills, and ability to express emotion.  Music makes a child a better learner, teaches self-control, improves coordination, enhances creativity, and inspires a lifetime appreciation of music and movement. -Listening activities help â€œtuneâ€ù a childâ€™s ear for improved areas in language and attention skills that ensure early school success.-Build social skills such as turn-taking and cooperation through group learning.-Strengthen memory and increase attention span through new songs, stories, and rhymes with sufficient repetition to help children remember what theyâ€™ve learned.-Boost vocabulary with a variety of poems, songs and stories.-Instrument play-alongs develop hand-eye-coordination, physical coordination, and a sense of steady beat to help carry out activities such as using a pair of scissors.-A multi-sensory approach to teach concepts such as loud and quiet or high and low strengthens the learning.-Stop-and-go, as well as creative movement and dance activities improve coordination, sequencing, self-control, the ability to follow directions, and plan and guide behavior.-Child-directed learning happens when children share ideas in class and at home with Home Kits.Research proves that early integration of music into your childs daily routine means improving his ability to think, reason, create, and express. With Kindermusik, the worldâ€™s most respected name in musical learning for nerborns to age 7, you and your child will participate together in every step of the learning process. Music skills to academic skills to life skills."

We'll be playing the original pressing by Creation Records. Coming at a cost of Â£250,000 Loveless pushed Alan McGeeâ€™s Creation Records to financial breaking point and also pushed the band themselves to the edge with personal disputes and relationship breakdowns all occurring along the way. Perhaps it was worth it as Kevin Shields quest for perfection and boundless faith ultimately served him well as Loveless is revered as not only the magnum opus of â€˜Shoegazeâ€™ but as one of the greatest rock albums ever created.Join us as we celebrate Loveless in style with album listening sessions around the world and experience My Bloody Valentine in a way you never have before.Read more here:http://classicalbumsundays.com/classic-album-sundays-presents-my-bloody-valentine-loveless/"

This week, we present Mark Normand Live!What can I say about Mark Normand that hasn't already been said about the charming boy next door? Well so far, Mark has done a Comedy Central HALF HOUR special, has appeared on TBSâ€™s CONAN 4 times, Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Showtimeâ€™s â€œLive at SXSWâ€ù, INSIDE AMY SCHUMER, TruTv, Best Week Ever, MTv, Last Comic Standing, @Midnight and released an album with Comedy Central records titled â€œStill Got Itâ€ù (itâ€™s not bad). This year, Mark took first place at the Great American Comedy Festival competition. In 2013 won Carolineâ€™s March Madness competition, beating out 63 other comedians. And this is a real shocker for all of us, but he was also voted Village Voiceâ€™s â€œBest Comedian of 2013â€ù, I know, right? In 2012, Mark appeared on â€œJohn Oliverâ€™s New York Standup Showâ€ù on Comedy Central, and in 2011 was picked as one of Comedy Centralâ€™s â€œComics to Watch.â€ùMark was born and raised in New Orleans, LA surprisingly to two normal parents. As a kid he spent most of his time shooting short films and wetting the bed. He started doing comedy right after college and quickly moved to New York. Mark now does comedy clubs and colleges across the country and has been involved in many festivals including Portland, Seattle, DC, Boston, Vancouver, Melbourne and in 2013 was featured as a New Face at the Montreal Comedy Festival.More annoying accolades that no one really cares about: Mark was named one of Comedy Centralâ€™s Comics To Watch for the 2011 New York Comedy Festival. Mark was also named Esquireâ€™s â€œBest New Comedians 2012â€ù, Splitsiderâ€™s â€œTop 10 Up and Coming Comedians on Each Coastâ€ù, and Time Out New Yorkâ€™s â€œ21 New York Comedy Scene Linchpinsâ€ù. And he regularly opens for Amy Schumer in small venues like Madison Square Garden.He'll be joined by: Brian Theriot, Frank Liotti, Alia Janine and more!This show is FREE but we do ask for a $10 Suggested Donation if possible. Food & drinks available all night. Seating starts at 7pm, get there early!"

If you don't know Roy Wood Jr. then shame on you. Currently a correspondent on The Daily Show w/ Trevor Noah, Roy has been described by the Hollywood Reporter as â€œA Standoutâ€ù, and Entertainment Weekly called his brand of thought provoking comedy as â€œcharismatic crankinessâ€ù. In 2016 â€˜Varietyâ€™ magazine named him one of 10 Comics to watch.Prior to â€˜The Daily Showâ€™ Roy spent three years on the TBSâ€˜ sitcom, Sullivan and Son. Heâ€™s currently a regular on Conan, ESPNâ€™s SportsNation & Comedy Centralâ€™s @midnight.A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Roy began his comedy career in 1998 at the age of 19 while attending Florida A&M University. He went on to make his television debut in 2006 on The Late Show with David Letterman. and finished third in the 2010 season of Last Comic Standing. Heâ€™s also appeared on HBOâ€™s Def Comedy Jam,  Comedy Centralâ€™s Premium Blend and The Late, Late Show with Craig FergusonPrior to this he also appeared at the 2006 Montreal Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in the â€œNew Faces Showcaseâ€ù. In 2006, Wood appeared on the Bob and Tom Radio Show: The Comedy Tour on Comedy Central.That's not including his 3 comedy albums. See, I told you should know about him.Roy is going to be joined by a mammoth line-up featuring Richie Redding (Katt Williams Tour), Petey DeAbreu (New York Comedy Festival), Ray DeVito (The Jim Gaffigan Show), Justin Hayes (Bad Boyz of Comedy) and Brian Theriot (Kegstand Comedy Podcast).

The book revolves around three arduous journeys he launched from his home base in Portland, Oregon, between 1969 and 1975.  The stories unfold against the familiar background of communes and collectives, Woodstock and Watergate, sex, dope, acid, rockâ€™nâ€™roll, and the end of civilization as we know it, but at heart this is not a history of those all too-well-chronicled times; itâ€™s a mythic private story of which we all have some idiosyncratic version of our own: the passage from wonderstruck childhood through tortured adulthood to contemplative old age."

The exhibition, which includes a newly commissioned series of works in an immersive installation across media, continues the artistâ€™s engagement with materials as a means of exploring wider conceptual dialogues surrounding structures of production within a specific geographic context. A core aspect of the show is the artistâ€™s collaboration with a community of skilled workers in Sheki, a historic town in Northern Azerbaijan, which was an important post on the ancient Silk Route. Most of the elements in the exhibition were sourced from Sheki Silk Factory, which today operates at a fraction of its Soviet period scale, when it used to employ around 7000 workers. Murillo collaborated with local artisans to create a series of large-scale works based on a medieval stained glass technique still practiced in the region and found in Shekiâ€™s famous Khanâ€™s Palace. The artist replaces the delicate material of glass with scraps of discarded metal from the factory yard, thereby playing with the original aesthetic and adding a political dimension to the poetic oriental design. Murillo frequently explores issues of community and migration drawing upon his own cultural heritage and that of others. Through a meaningful collaboration with the Sheki silk factory and the townâ€™s community, these discourses manifest themselves through both the materials he chooses to use and a revival of the factory as a site of production. This exhibition is curated by Suad Garayeva-Maleki*Special thanks to Tunc LLC and Sheki Ipek JSC.Exhibition opening day: 11 November 2016 at 7 pm  Location: YARAT Contemporary Art Centre (National Flag Square, Bayil, AZ1003)Dates: 11 November â€“ 29 January 2017 Exhibition open: Tuesday through Sunday, from 11:00 until 20:00. Admission is free For more information about YARAT: www.yarat.azFor media and image enquiries please contact:  Hokuma Karimova Telephone: +99 450 2746747 Email: hokuma.k@yarat.az***___¡___ê_  _œ_£_ _˜_›_¬__DIS PLACE ___µ__Ñ‚Ñ€ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT, _‘_°_ºÑƒ, _ê_·_µÑ€_±_°___´_¶_°___ŸÑ€__ÑÅÑ‚Ñ€_°__ÑÅÑ‚____ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT _¿Ñ€_µ_´ÑÅÑ‚_°___»Ñè_µÑ‚ ___°ÑÅÑˆÑ‚_°_±__ÑƒÑ_ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___ºÑƒ _º___»Ñƒ___±_¸__ÑÅ_º______ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_° __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€_° _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__. _ù_° __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_µ  _±Ñƒ_´_µÑ‚ _¿Ñ€_µ_´ÑÅÑ‚_°___»_µ___° _°_±ÑÅ___»Ñ_Ñ‚____ _______°Ñè _°Ñ‚____ÑÅÑ„_µÑ€___°Ñè _¸__ÑÅÑ‚_°_»_»ÑèÑ†_¸Ñè, ÑÅ___·_´_°Ñ_Ñ‰_°Ñè ÑçÑ„Ñ„_µ_ºÑ‚ _¿Ñ€_¸ÑÅÑƒÑ‚ÑÅÑ‚___¸Ñè, _±_»_°_____´_°Ñ€Ñè ÑÅ__Ñ‡_µÑ‚_°___¸Ñ_ Ñ€_°_·_»_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ‚_µÑ…___¸_º. _¡_µÑ€_¸Ñè _¿Ñ€___´___»_¶_°_µÑ‚ _¿___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚_º_¸ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_°  Ñ‡_µÑ€_µ_· Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚Ñƒ ÑÅ Ñ€_°_·_»_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹___¸ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»_°___¸ _¸ÑÅÑÅ_»_µ_´_____°Ñ‚ÑŒ  _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ __Ñ‚____Ñˆ_µ___¸Ñè __ ÑÅ_¿_µÑ†_¸Ñ„_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º____ ___µ____Ñ€_°Ñ„_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º____ _º____Ñ‚_µ_ºÑÅÑ‚_µ.__ÑÅ________Ñ‹__ Ñç_»_µ___µ__Ñ‚____ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸ ÑÅÑ‚_°_»_° _º___»_»_°_±__Ñ€_°Ñ†_¸Ñè Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º_° ÑÅ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚___¸_º_°___¸ Ñˆ_µ_»_º__-_¿Ñ€Ñè_´_¸_»ÑŒ______ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸ __ _¨_µ_º_¸, ___´______ _¸_· ÑÅÑ‚_°Ñ€_µ__Ñˆ_¸Ñ… ____Ñ€___´____ ___° ÑÅ_µ___µÑ€_µ _ê_·_µÑ€_±_°___´_¶_°___°. __Ñ‚__Ñ‚ ____Ñ€___´, Ñ€_°ÑÅ_¿___»___¶_µ____Ñ‹__ Ñƒ _¿___´_____¶_¸Ñè ___°___º_°_·ÑÅ_º_¸Ñ… ____Ñ€, _±Ñ‹_» _º_____´_°-Ñ‚__  ___´___¸__ _¸_· Ñ„__Ñ€_¿__ÑÅÑ‚____  _’_µ_»_¸_º______ _¨_µ_»_º__________ _ŸÑƒÑ‚_¸. _‘___»ÑŒÑˆ_°Ñè Ñ‡_°ÑÅÑ‚ÑŒ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»____, _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°____Ñ‹Ñ… _´_»Ñè ÑÅ___·_´_°___¸Ñè __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°____Ñ‡__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚, _±Ñ‹_»_° _¿Ñ€_µ_´__ÑÅÑ‚_°___»_µ___° _¸___µ______ _¨_µ_º_¸__ÑÅ_º____ Ñˆ_µ_»_º___¿Ñ€Ñè_´_¸_»ÑŒ______ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º____, _º__Ñ‚__Ñ€_°Ñè __ _¡_____µÑ‚ÑÅ_º___µ __Ñ€_µ__Ñè ___±_µÑÅ_¿_µÑ‡_¸___°_»_° Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚____ 7000 ÑÅ__Ñ‚Ñ€Ñƒ_´___¸_º____. _¡_µ_____´__Ñè _¶_µ _µ_µ _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ ____Ñ‰____ÑÅÑ‚_¸ _·_°_´_µ__ÑÅÑ‚_______°__Ñ‹ _»_¸ÑˆÑŒ __ ___µ_±___»ÑŒÑˆ____ ÑÅÑ‚_µ_¿_µ___¸. _’___µÑÅÑ‚_µ ÑÅ ___µÑÅÑ‚__Ñ‹___¸ Ñ€_µ___µÑÅ_»_µ_____¸_º_°___¸ __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€ _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__ ÑÅ___·_´_°_» ÑÅ_µÑ€_¸Ñ_ _ºÑ€Ñƒ_¿_______°_±_°Ñ€_¸Ñ‚__Ñ‹Ñ… Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚ ÑÅ _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°___¸_µ__ ÑÅÑ€_µ_´___µ___µ_º________ ___¸Ñ‚Ñ€_°_¶______ Ñ‚_µÑ…___¸_º_¸, _º__Ñ‚__Ñ€_°Ñè _¿__ ÑÅ_µ__ _´_µ__ÑŒ Ñ€_°ÑÅ_¿Ñ€__ÑÅÑ‚Ñ€_°___µ___° __ Ñ€_µ___¸_____°Ñ… _¸ _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°___° __ __Ñ„__Ñ€___»_µ___¸_¸ _¥_°__ÑÅ_º______ _”____Ñ€Ñ†_° __ ____Ñ€___´_µ _¨_µ_º_¸. _’ _´_°________ ÑÅ_»ÑƒÑ‡_°_µ Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_º _·_°___µ___¸_» Ñ…Ñ€Ñƒ_¿_º___µ ÑÅÑ‚_µ_º_»__ ___° ___±Ñ€_µ_·_º_¸ ___µÑ‚_°_»_»_°, ___°___´_µ____Ñ‹_µ ____ _´____Ñ€_µ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸. _’ _¸Ñ‚_____µ Ñ€___¶_´_°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè ___µ_º_°Ñè ÑçÑÅÑ‚_µÑ‚_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º_°Ñè _¸__Ñ€_° _¸ ___° _¿__ÑçÑ‚_¸Ñ‡__Ñ‹__ ____ÑÅÑ‚__Ñ‡__Ñ‹__ _´_µ_º__Ñ€ ___°_º_»_°_´Ñ‹___°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè _¿___»_¸Ñ‚_¸Ñ‡_µÑÅ_º_¸__ _°ÑÅ_¿_µ_ºÑ‚. __ÑÅ_º_°Ñ€ _œÑƒÑ€_¸_»ÑŒ__  Ñ‡_°ÑÅÑ‚__ ___±Ñ€_°Ñ‰_°_µÑ‚ÑÅÑè _º Ñ‚_µ___°__ _¶_¸_·___¸ __ ÑÅ_____±Ñ‰_µÑÅÑ‚___µ _¸ Ñ‚_µ___µ ___¸__Ñ€_°Ñ†_¸_¸, ___¿_¸Ñ€_°ÑèÑÅÑŒ ___° ÑÅ___±ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹__ _ºÑƒ_»ÑŒÑ‚ÑƒÑ€__Ñ‹__ ___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ _¸ ___¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ _´Ñ€Ñƒ___¸Ñ… _»Ñ__´_µ__. _‘_»_°_____´_°Ñ€Ñè _¿Ñ€___´Ñƒ___°________Ñƒ ÑÅ__Ñ‚Ñ€Ñƒ_´___¸Ñ‡_µÑÅÑ‚__Ñƒ ÑÅ Ñˆ_µ_º_¸__ÑÅ_º____ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º____ _¸ ____Ñ€___´ÑÅ_º_¸___¸ ___»_°ÑÅÑ‚Ñè___¸, Ñ…Ñƒ_´___¶___¸_ºÑƒ Ñƒ_´_°_»__ÑÅÑŒ Ñ€_°ÑÅ_ºÑ€Ñ‹Ñ‚ÑŒ Ñ‚_µ__Ñƒ Ñ‡_µÑ€_µ_· _¸ÑÅ_¿___»ÑŒ_·_____°____Ñ‹_µ __ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚_µ ___°Ñ‚_µÑ€_¸_°_»Ñ‹, _° Ñ‚_°_º_¶_µ Ñƒ_´_°_»__ÑÅÑŒ ___µÑ€__ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ _¿Ñ€___¸_·_____´ÑÅÑ‚___µ____Ñ‹_µ ____Ñ‰____ÑÅÑ‚_¸ Ñ„_°_±Ñ€_¸_º_¸ _º _¶_¸_·___¸.__ÑƒÑ€_°Ñ‚__Ñ€ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: _¡Ñƒ_°_´ _“_°Ñ€_°_µ___°-_œ_°_»_µ_º_¸*_’Ñ‹Ñ€_°_¶_°_µ__ __ÑÅ___±ÑƒÑ_ _±_»_°_____´_°Ñ€____ÑÅÑ‚ÑŒ __O__ Tunc _¸ OAO Sheki Ipek.__Ñ‚_ºÑ€Ñ‹Ñ‚_¸_µ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: 11 ____Ñè_±Ñ€Ñè 2016-____ _____´_°, __ 19.00_ê_´Ñ€_µÑÅ: ___µ__Ñ‚Ñ€ _¡____Ñ€_µ___µ__________ _˜ÑÅ_ºÑƒÑÅÑÅÑ‚___° YARAT (_Ÿ_»__Ñ‰_°_´ÑŒ _“__ÑÅÑƒ_´_°Ñ€ÑÅÑ‚___µ__________ ___»_°___°, _‘_°_¸_»______, AZ1003)_”_°Ñ‚_° __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: 11 _ù__Ñè_±Ñ€ÑŒ 2016 â€“ 29 _¯_____°Ñ€ÑŒ 2017_§_°ÑÅÑ‹ Ñ€_°_±__Ñ‚Ñ‹ __Ñ‹ÑÅÑ‚_°___º_¸: _’Ñ‚__Ñ€___¸_º -

Landrieu was first elected to the Louisiana state legislature at the age of 23. In 1996 she became the first woman from Louisiana elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Senator Landrieu has been the leading voice in Washington for the Gulf Coast recovery effort. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the failures of the federal levee system, she secured billions in recovery dollars and has worked extensively to jumpstart recovery projects. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Senator Landrieu introduced the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act, which will, for the first time, direct 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties paid by BP directly to the Gulf Coast.ABOUT JEFF HEBERTJeff Hebert is the Executive Director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority where he is responsible for redevelopment projects for the City of New Orleans and the successful disposition of over 3,000 properties that were acquired through the stateâ€™s housing recovery program.Jeff found his way back home in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita serving as the Director of Community Planning for the Louisiana Recovery Authority where he was tasked with working with local governments throughout the state to develop recovery plans â€“ including the Unified New Orleans Plan.Jeff has received a Bachelors in Urban Design & Architecture Studies from NYU and a Masters of City Planning from MIT.Jeff is currently a board member of the Young Leadership Council, Second Harvest Food Bank, Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation and the United Way Vision Council.ABOUT DAVID WAGGONNERDavid Waggonner is the president of Waggonner & Ball Architects, an award-winning architecture and planning practice located in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is also the initiator of Dutch Dialogues, an exchange between Dutch engineering and design professionals and their American counterparts focused on water-based urban design. Over the course of three Dutch Dialogue conferences, David has articulated a new vision of New Orleans as a delta city living with â€“ rather than against â€“ water to address long-term development of urban character and form.David is currently leading a team of local and international experts to develop a Comprehensive Water Management Strategy for the Greater New Orleans region. Ultimately the teamsâ€™ goal is to develop a model of sustainable delta urbanism that embraces water in all its forms to improve safety and resiliency, grow the economy and provide public amenities. The plan is scheduled for completion in late 2012.SUPPORTBeyond the High Line is presented by Friends of the High Line in partnership with the Rails to Trails Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land.

Sq. Art, weaves together excerpts from popular films, ranging from Fitzcarraldo to Twin Peaks in which nature is the only character featured onscreen.  These short clips are edited together to form what the artist calls a â€œvideo collageâ€ù or seamless montage, before being translated through freehand, computer assisted digital animation.  The resulting animated video stands as a visually striking and original work containing subtle, but deliberate echoes of iconic cultural moments embedded in our collective unconscious.  In much the same way that Madison Square Park presents a cultivated and aestheticized side of nature, wildlife and green space amidst the urban landscape of central Manhattan, City of Nature examines the ways in which popular culture presents aestheticized images of the natural work, â€œunnaturalâ€ù visions of nature that embed themselves in our cultural memory and media landscape more deeply than we may consciously know.The video will run daily from 11am to 9pm, Mar 31 to May 15."

Artist Kimsooja spent several days at the center and asked the residents about their lives, background, families and memories. She spent time getting to know them, gaining their trust and support and then filmed them over a period of two weeks. Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.http://link.sva.edu/fVHz7G"

Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.http://link.sva.edu/fVHz7G"

Two performances are scheduled at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Free admission and no reservations necessary.The MMC dance majors have been working with the Tharp choreographic material during the spring semester and they are now prepared to share their experience with other dancers, dance enthusiasts and individuals who love movement and movement invention. Veteran Tharp dancers Rose Marie Wright and Jennifer Way have been on campus contributing their expertise and assisting Associate Professor of Dance Anthony Ferro â€™01, M.F.A., in mounting the work. Professor of Dance Katie Langan â€™92 B.A., who also serves as chair of the MMC dance department and Ferro are former dancers with Twyla Tharp Dance.Twyla Tharpâ€™s THE ONE HUNDREDS was first performed in 1970. In her words, the dance is â€œ...an exercise in aesthetic and physical deterioration. This dance is a series of 100 11-second movement phrases performed in three sections. In the first section, two skilled dancers, in unison, perform 100 movement phrases separated by four seconds of stillness (approximately 25 minutes); in the second section, five dancers perform 20 phrases each without pause (approximately five minutes); and in the third section, 100 people perform one phrase each (11 seconds). The movements are based on activities that anyone, including untrained dancers, could doâ€”such as skip, hop, shiver, and shakeâ€”and are performed in silence. As the time diminishes, so does the rigor and definition of the dancing. And at the climactic display of 100 soloists, the phrases become mere shadows of themselves."

Priestly from Wednesday, March 9 through Saturday, March 12 at 8 p.m. and on Sunday, March 13 at 2 p.m. in the Theresa Lang Theatre, located at 221 East 71st Street. Time and the Conways (1937) is a meditation on J. W. Dunneâ€™s theory of serial time, attesting that time is not merely a linear progression, but a concept that simultaneously contains past, present and future. The play follows the story of the seemingly perfect Conway familyâ€”Act One presents their perfect day, Act Two their worst day, and Act Three, the realization that their travails have paralleled the vanquished ideals of the British people between the wars. This production is performed by students in the Theatre Arts programs of the College with direction by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts Kevin Connell, scenic design by Sofia Palacios Blanca, costume design by Elise Vanderkley, lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, sound design by Meghan Rose Murphy, and dialect and text coaching by Professor of Theatre Arts Barbara Adrian. General admission tickets are $10. Tickets for senior citizens and students of others schools (with valid ID) are $5, and admission is free of charge for MMC students, alumni, faculty, and staff (with valid MMC ID).

His simple, honest approach tells stories that hit at the heart of American life. Blending a folk-meets-soul style to go along with thoughtful lyrics and images, John sings about his life in real terms. His album ""Ophelia,"" due out on 11/12/10, is his loftiest work to date. Produced by Caleb Hawley, we see on ""Ophelia"" just how life in the city has affected Schmitt, now a resident of Brooklyn, as he takes us along for many stories of life, love, loss, and coffee consumption.Ladies' Night - $5.00 Margaritas, $5.00 Cosmos, $5.00 Well Drinks, $4.00 Shots, $4.00 Well Shots, $3.00 Bud Lights"

Elias Pavlopoulos and Scott A. Small discuss their new study, the science of age-related memory loss, and the prospects for helping people recover their ability to remember.Recently, researchers with the Kavli Institute for Brain Science (KIBS) at Columbia University found compelling evidence that age-related memory loss is a syndrome in its own right, apart from Alzheimerâ€™s. In fact, in the case of one type of age-related memory loss  -- again, distinct from Alzheimer's -- researchers were able to restore memory function in mice so that it was comparable to that of young mice. These are exciting findings that, along with implications for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of memory disorders, may in the future have significant public health consequences.Submit a question for the team on Twitter using #KavliLive."

The Dr's sent me for a 2 hour fetal echo where they look at every part of her heart...It was recommended I abort. We then flew to Boston where they told us she only had a 75% chance of living until she was 3. Then we went to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they explained exactly what Valentina had and the 3 heart surgeries she would be getting to ""fix"" her heart.  The first at 3 days old the 2nd at 6 months old and her 3rd at 2-3 years old.She was born in Philadelphia on February 15th with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome which is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is underdeveloped so her right ventricle is doing the work for both. She also has Heterotaxy, which is where her heart and some of her organs are reversed, and Asplenia, which means she has no spleen.On February 18th she had her 1st surgery which went amazing.  We were home 8 days later. Her second surgery was scheduled for August 28 but on July 10 her oxygen level dropped and she was transported to Philadelphia to have surgery that week. The surgery went well but her recovery wasn't great. She got sick and ended up coming home a month later. Because of her heterotaxy her intestines were mal rotated,  so in November she had surgery to correct them.We were lucky enough to be able to be with our daughter through her surgeries and stay in a hotel close to the hospital. Being there we met many families that weren't able to afford to stay near the hospital and families that couldn't take off work to be with their babies all day. A portion of the money that we are donating to the hospital is going to the cardiac social work department so they can help the families be able to make it work so they can be with their babies.  Another portion is going to the cardiac child life program which is so special. Some of these cardiac babies are there for months at a time, like one of valentina's  roommates who was there from the day he was born until his 1st birthday where he received his heart transplant. So the cardiac child life tries to make these children's stays a little bit more enjoyable with games, arts and crafts and music class.And the last portion is going to cardiac research because hopefully Valentina will get to grow up get married have babies and live a long fulfilling life which if she was born 30 years ago, she probably wouldn't have been able to.$50 donations to take part in our fundraiser!Non-members are allowed to participate with a Valid Photo IDMinors must be accompanied by a parent.

Oddo will host a mobile mammography van outside of Borough Hall on Thursday, May 8, 2014, beginning at 9am. The screenings will be available to women ages 40 and older who have not had a mammogram in the past year.â€œWomen need to be made aware of risk factors and see a doctor â€“ they need to take care of themselves too, so they can be there for their families,â€ù noted Marion Smith, RN, Cancer Program Coordinator at Richmond University Medical Center.  Mammograms are still the best way to detect changes and disease, Island experts agree. â€œMammograms are important preventative measures for women. The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,â€ù noted Borough President Oddo. â€œBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.â€ùIn addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  â€œAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,â€ù noted Ms. Smith. â€œWomen are afraid, they donâ€™t want to know.â€ùBut knowing is exactly what can save their lives.The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.In addition, a mini-womenâ€™s health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the Mayorâ€™s Office to Combat Domestic Violence.All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening."

The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,â€ù noted Borough President Oddo. â€œBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.â€ùIn addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  â€œAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,â€ù noted Ms. Smith. â€œWomen are afraid, they donâ€™t want to know.â€ùBut knowing is exactly what can save their lives.The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.In addition, a mini-womenâ€™s health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the Mayorâ€™s Office to Combat Domestic Violence.All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening."
