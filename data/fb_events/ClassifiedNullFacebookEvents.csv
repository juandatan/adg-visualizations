WHAT IS CAPOEIRA?

Developed in the 1500Ûªs by enslaved Africans in Brazil, Capoeira is a unique art form that blends self-defense techniques, acrobatics, dance-like movements and music into a martial art form.

The capoeira game is played in a circle called a roda, where two capoeiristas engage in a spontaneous conversation of movements, corporal expression, and self-defense techniques (kicks, dodges, take-downs, etc) accompanied by graceful acrobatics and music.  The capoeiristas emphasize on control of their movements, quick strategy and reaction to smoothly trick each other and conquer one anotherÛªs space.

Those who form the roda clap, sing and play hand-made percussive instruments such as the berimbau, the atabaque (drum), the pandeiro (tambourine), and the agogÌ« (cowbells). Music is essential in capoeira.  The rhythm played by the berimbau determines the type of game that takes place.  The rhythm also sets the pace of the game, movements and characteristics of a given game.

Songs are sung in a call and response format or in the form of narratives. Typically songs can tell stories about capoeira figures, anecdotes, tales, life deceptions or victories, humor, etc.  Often the capoeira singer uses songs to comment on the game being played at the moment, thus making the capoeira roda as spontaneous as it can be.",0

WHAT IS CAPOEIRA?

Developed in the 1500Ûªs by enslaved Africans in Brazil, Capoeira is a unique art form that blends self-defense techniques, acrobatics, dance-like movements and music into a martial art form.

The capoeira game is played in a circle called a roda, where two capoeiristas engage in a spontaneous conversation of movements, corporal expression, and self-defense techniques (kicks, dodges, take-downs, etc) accompanied by graceful acrobatics and music.  The capoeiristas emphasize on control of their movements, quick strategy and reaction to smoothly trick each other and conquer one anotherÛªs space.

Those who form the roda clap, sing and play hand-made percussive instruments such as the berimbau, the atabaque (drum), the pandeiro (tambourine), and the agogÌ« (cowbells). Music is essential in capoeira.  The rhythm played by the berimbau determines the type of game that takes place.  The rhythm also sets the pace of the game, movements and characteristics of a given game.

Songs are sung in a call and response format or in the form of narratives. Typically songs can tell stories about capoeira figures, anecdotes, tales, life deceptions or victories, humor, etc.  Often the capoeira singer uses songs to comment on the game being played at the moment, thus making the capoeira roda as spontaneous as it can be.",0

ÛÏFor many states that were once great have now become small; and those that were great in my time were small before. Knowing therefore that human prosperity never continues in the same place, I shall mention both alike.Û --Herodotus

Change is nothing new. Academics and public intellectuals have always struggled with change, examining its nature and effects through the lenses of literature, science, philosophy, theology, sociology, economics, and psychology. These studies have regarded change as a driving force, variously positive and negative, but always present. This conference will explore change as a theme and inspiration of both academic discourse and scientific exploration, from antiquity to the present day and beyond. 

We invite papers/posters and panel/session proposals from all disciplines focusing on works from any period that explore change as it is discussed in literature, philosophy, theory, art, film, science, or society and its effects on the study of the same. Possible topics falling under this heading include, but are not limited to: Difficulties posed by change; Persistence of identity throughout change; Varieties of change; Conditions of change; Beginning and ending; Change and the individual; Climate and environmental change; Regime change and revolution; Paradigm shifts; Gender; Race; Education; Representation; Love; Death; Scientific change; Evolutionary change; and Societal change.

To submit to the conference please go to our website and follow the directions.

The 2016 Voices Up! Concert, the seventh in Fordham UniversityÛªs annual series of events combining music and poetry, will take place at FordhamÛªs Lincoln Center campus on Tuesday, April 12th, 2016, at 7:30 PM. The venue is the 12th floor lounge of the Lowenstein Building, 113 W. 60th Street (NW corner, 60th St and Columbus Avenue). Admission is free and open to the public.

Voices Up! is devoted to new work by both poets and composers. It is unique in New York City in its commitment to bringing todayÛªs poetry and music together and to inviting and performing new vocal compositions. The series showcases premieres of newly composed settings of poems from the most recent prizewinning volumes in Fordham University PressÛªs Poets Out Loud Publication Prize series, together with other newly composed songs and song cycles. The poets are usually on hand to read their work; the audience first hears the poetry in the poetÛªs own voice and then hears how the composer has reimagined it musically. The concerts to date have featured work by internationally known composers including Victoria Bond, David Dzubay, Paul Moravec, and Lawrence Kramer, Distinguished Professor of English and Music at Fordham. Performers have included the renowned tenor Rufus MÌ_ller and rising stars including sopranos Sharon Harms and Lucy Dhegrae, the violin-cello duo of Madalyn and Cicely Parnas, and the dynamic young ensembles Contemporaneous and TIGUE Percussion.

In a collaborative effort, Children FIRST will join the Ravazzin Center on Aging for a conference that merges the groupsÛª two separate missions: one that focuses on the helping the aging, and the other which focuses on helping the young.

The event, titled ÛÏPractice Across the Lifespan: Intergenerational Work in Action,Û will take place on Wed., March 9, at FordhamÛªs Westchester campus from 11:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. National policy and best practices will be discussed in lectures an breakout sessions.

ÛÏWe often silo child welfare and care for the aging,Û said Janna Heyman, PhD, professor and director of the Ravazzin Center. ÛÏWhat weÛªre trying to foster is a way to blend the services.Û

Heyman said that several studies have shown that it is mutually beneficial for children and older adults to work together on crafts, story times, dance, and play. Many of the programs she studies often operate at the same site, rather than bussing the children in from another location to be with the older adults.

ÛÏThereÛªs a lot or rich opportunities, not just for families, but also in the broader sense of the community,Û said Heyman.

She added that in the past there may have been a custom of parents living in the home to take care of grandchildren, but new programming is far larger scope bringing the custom into the community. She added that avoiding duplication of services is also a practical matter.

ÛÏMany retirees find it extremely beneficial to help students with their reading and some of the youth help the adults become computer literate,Û she said. ÛÏBut while there may be savings in cost, more importantly there is the value of enriching lives.Û",0

ÛÏFor many states that were once great have now become small; and those that were great in my time were small before. Knowing therefore that human prosperity never continues in the same place, I shall mention both alike.Û --Herodotus

Change is nothing new. Academics and public intellectuals have always struggled with change, examining its nature and effects through the lenses of literature, science, philosophy, theology, sociology, economics, and psychology. These studies have regarded change as a driving force, variously positive and negative, but always present. This conference will explore change as a theme and inspiration of both academic discourse and scientific exploration, from antiquity to the present day and beyond. 

We invite papers/posters and panel/session proposals from all disciplines focusing on works from any period that explore change as it is discussed in literature, philosophy, theory, art, film, science, or society and its effects on the study of the same. Possible topics falling under this heading include, but are not limited to: Difficulties posed by change; Persistence of identity throughout change; Varieties of change; Conditions of change; Beginning and ending; Change and the individual; Climate and environmental change; Regime change and revolution; Paradigm shifts; Gender; Race; Education; Representation; Love; Death; Scientific change; Evolutionary change; and Societal change.

To submit to the conference please go to our website and follow the directions.

The 2016 Voices Up! Concert, the seventh in Fordham UniversityÛªs annual series of events combining music and poetry, will take place at FordhamÛªs Lincoln Center campus on Tuesday, April 12th, 2016, at 7:30 PM. The venue is the 12th floor lounge of the Lowenstein Building, 113 W. 60th Street (NW corner, 60th St and Columbus Avenue). Admission is free and open to the public.

Voices Up! is devoted to new work by both poets and composers. It is unique in New York City in its commitment to bringing todayÛªs poetry and music together and to inviting and performing new vocal compositions. The series showcases premieres of newly composed settings of poems from the most recent prizewinning volumes in Fordham University PressÛªs Poets Out Loud Publication Prize series, together with other newly composed songs and song cycles. The poets are usually on hand to read their work; the audience first hears the poetry in the poetÛªs own voice and then hears how the composer has reimagined it musically. The concerts to date have featured work by internationally known composers including Victoria Bond, David Dzubay, Paul Moravec, and Lawrence Kramer, Distinguished Professor of English and Music at Fordham. Performers have included the renowned tenor Rufus MÌ_ller and rising stars including sopranos Sharon Harms and Lucy Dhegrae, the violin-cello duo of Madalyn and Cicely Parnas, and the dynamic young ensembles Contemporaneous and TIGUE Percussion.

Lucy Dhegrae will return for the 2016 concert together with baritone Kelvin Chan and pianist and composer Joshua Groffmann. The program will include both solo songs and duets; settings of poems from the prizewinning volumes by Gregory Mahrer (A Provisional Map of the Lost Continent) and Nancy K. Pearson (The Whole by Contemplation of a Single Bone); a setting by FordhamÛªs Daniel Ott of two poems by the Pulitzer Prize winning poet Gregory Pardlo; and music by Chester Biscardi, Joshua Groffman, Lawrence Kramer, Sky Macklay, Yangzhi Ma, and Aleksandra Vrebalov",1

In a collaborative effort, Children FIRST will join the Ravazzin Center on Aging for a conference that merges the groupsÛª two separate missions: one that focuses on the helping the aging, and the other which focuses on helping the young.

The event, titled ÛÏPractice Across the Lifespan: Intergenerational Work in Action,Û will take place on Wed., March 9, at FordhamÛªs Westchester campus from 11:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. National policy and best practices will be discussed in lectures an breakout sessions.

ÛÏWe often silo child welfare and care for the aging,Û said Janna Heyman, PhD, professor and director of the Ravazzin Center. ÛÏWhat weÛªre trying to foster is a way to blend the services.Û

Heyman said that several studies have shown that it is mutually beneficial for children and older adults to work together on crafts, story times, dance, and play. Many of the programs she studies often operate at the same site, rather than bussing the children in from another location to be with the older adults.

ÛÏThereÛªs a lot or rich opportunities, not just for families, but also in the broader sense of the community,Û said Heyman.

She added that in the past there may have been a custom of parents living in the home to take care of grandchildren, but new programming is far larger scope bringing the custom into the community. She added that avoiding duplication of services is also a practical matter.

ÛÏMany retirees find it extremely beneficial to help students with their reading and some of the youth help the adults become computer literate,Û she said. ÛÏBut while there may be savings in cost, more importantly there is the value of enriching lives.Û",0

It artfully depicts images of revered saints and is the centerpiece of a traditional procession in Italian         neighborhoods throughout the world. This will be the third year that BelmontÛªs own giglio will be built and carried through the streets. 
	It takes over 100 lifters, or paranza In Italian, to hoist this enormous structure up on their shoulders as they carry it through the streets while performing various ritual maneuvers.  A band is carried upon the giglio as they play traditional music associated with  the celebration, as well as other Italian and American favorites. 
	The ÛÏDancing of the GiglioÛ will take place at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church on the corner of East 187th Street and Belmont Avenue. The official procession will start on Saturday, June 14 at approximately 2pm.",1

Hunts Point and Mott Haven,2016-05-27T08:00:00-0400,"The CrossFit Games are the worldÛªs premier test to find the Fittest on Earth.

In order to find the fittest, CrossFit has to cast a wide net. The three-stage CrossFit Games season acts as a funnel, starting with the all-inclusive online Open, advancing to the selective live regionals, and concluding with an elite few on a world stage at the CrossFit Games.

The 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games East Regional features the fittest men, women, and teams from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. 41,000 athletes from these two regions entered the Open, but only the top-40 men, 40 women, and 30 6-person teams were invited to compete at the East Regional (May 27-29).

Over the course of the three-day weekend, the athletes will face a barrage of tests designed to reveal any flaws in their fitness. Can they do well in long events? Short events? Heavy lifting? Gymnastics? To make it to the Games, these athletes must be true generalists capable of handling any task thrown at them.

The five men, five women, and five teams who do the best in relation to their peers across all of the events will be invited to compete at the CrossFit Games held at the StubHub Center in Carson, California July 19-24.

The East Regional will be held at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.

Regional tickets cost $75 for three days of access, or $30 per day.

Kids 12 and under are admitted free of charge with a ticketed adult.

Each affiliate owner (Licensee of Record) will receive a complimentary three-day ticket to their local regional. These complimentary tickets will be available via will call and are transferrable. Learn more at games.crossfit.com",0

Hunts Point and Mott Haven,2016-02-25T17:00:00-0800,"Registration for the Open begins Jan. 14, 2016.

More than 272,000 people from around the globe competed in the Open last year. As the largest CrossFit community event of the season, the Open ties together athletes from within the same gym to those in their broader city, country and world.

For five weeks, youÛÓand the hundreds of thousands of other people who signed upÛÓare at the whim of the Director of the Games Dave Castro, taking on workouts that may push you to learn a new skill, improve the skills you already have or go into a darker place than youÛªve ever been before.

The Open welcomes anyone 14 to 100 years old. (WeÛªll take any centenarians, too.) All you need to do is sign up, and enter a score each week. You can complete the workouts at a participating CrossFit affiliate in front of a judge, or film your performance from anywhere you want and submit a link as proof.

To make the Open even more accessible, we introduced a scaled option in 2015. Each time a workout is released, athletes will be given two versions: RxÛªd and Scaled. The Scaled-workout option is designed to be accessible to the majority of people who attend CrossFit affiliates. If you do CrossFit, thereÛªs a very high chance you can do the Open, too.

Workouts are released each week on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, and athletes have four days or 96 hours to complete the workout and submit their score. Scores are due before 5 p.m. PT that Monday.

Five Weeks | Feb. 25 - March 28, 2016
16.1: Feb. 25 - 29
16.2: March 3 - 7
16.3: March 10 - 14
16.4 March 17 - 21
16.5 March 24 - 28

The fittest athletes will advance to the next stage of the season.

Hunts Point and Mott Haven,2016-05-27T08:00:00-0400,"The CrossFit Games are the worldÛªs premier test to find the Fittest on Earth.

In order to find the fittest, CrossFit has to cast a wide net. The three-stage CrossFit Games season acts as a funnel, starting with the all-inclusive online Open, advancing to the selective live regionals, and concluding with an elite few on a world stage at the CrossFit Games.

The 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games East Regional features the fittest men, women, and teams from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. 41,000 athletes from these two regions entered the Open, but only the top-40 men, 40 women, and 30 6-person teams were invited to compete at the East Regional (May 27-29).

Over the course of the three-day weekend, the athletes will face a barrage of tests designed to reveal any flaws in their fitness. Can they do well in long events? Short events? Heavy lifting? Gymnastics? To make it to the Games, these athletes must be true generalists capable of handling any task thrown at them.

The five men, five women, and five teams who do the best in relation to their peers across all of the events will be invited to compete at the CrossFit Games held at the StubHub Center in Carson, California July 19-24.

The East Regional will be held at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.

Regional tickets cost $75 for three days of access, or $30 per day.

Kids 12 and under are admitted free of charge with a ticketed adult.

Each affiliate owner (Licensee of Record) will receive a complimentary three-day ticket to their local regional. These complimentary tickets will be available via will call and are transferrable. Learn more at games.crossfit.com",0

Hunts Point and Mott Haven,2016-02-25T17:00:00-0800,"Registration for the Open begins Jan. 14, 2016.

More than 272,000 people from around the globe competed in the Open last year. As the largest CrossFit community event of the season, the Open ties together athletes from within the same gym to those in their broader city, country and world.

For five weeks, youÛÓand the hundreds of thousands of other people who signed upÛÓare at the whim of the Director of the Games Dave Castro, taking on workouts that may push you to learn a new skill, improve the skills you already have or go into a darker place than youÛªve ever been before.

The Open welcomes anyone 14 to 100 years old. (WeÛªll take any centenarians, too.) All you need to do is sign up, and enter a score each week. You can complete the workouts at a participating CrossFit affiliate in front of a judge, or film your performance from anywhere you want and submit a link as proof.

To make the Open even more accessible, we introduced a scaled option in 2015. Each time a workout is released, athletes will be given two versions: RxÛªd and Scaled. The Scaled-workout option is designed to be accessible to the majority of people who attend CrossFit affiliates. If you do CrossFit, thereÛªs a very high chance you can do the Open, too.

Workouts are released each week on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, and athletes have four days or 96 hours to complete the workout and submit their score. Scores are due before 5 p.m. PT that Monday.

Five Weeks | Feb. 25 - March 28, 2016
16.1: Feb. 25 - 29
16.2: March 3 - 7
16.3: March 10 - 14
16.4 March 17 - 21
16.5 March 24 - 28

The fittest athletes will advance to the next stage of the season.

Kingsbridge and Riverdale,2016-04-10T14:00:00-0400,"Please join us to meet the artists featured in Wave HillÛªs spring exhibitions. 

In Glyndor Gallery, (Not So) Still Life presents novel ways that contemporary artists are transforming the still life genre to engage with current culture. As a subject, the still life has remained popular since the early Renaissance, featuring compositions of natural and inanimate objects often presented with allegorical connotations. Today, artists are creating new variations by working in photography and sculpture to conflate interior space with landscape, or by using video and animation to convey still life in motion. Artists include Adam Brent, Elizabeth Bryant, Nicole Cohen, Ori Gersht, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Sue Johnson, Laura Letinsky, Beth Lipman, Erin OÛªKeefe, Donna Sharrett, Nicolas Touron, Michael Vahrenwald, Rodrigo Valenzuela and Alex Verhaest. 

In the Sunroom Project Space, Tai Hwa Goh explores the controlled natural environment of greenhouses, contemplating the intersection of the organic and the human-made realms. 

Also at todayÛªs reception will be the two artists whose paintings are on view in Wave Hill House: Rachael Wren and Caroline Larsen.

During the Winter Workspace, Sindy Butz will continue research on two video projects, one that is focused on the Palisades and the other on 11th century German nun St. Hildegard von Bingen and her medicinal study of rocks and botanicals. 

TodayÛªs workshop will encourage the examination of two very different histories and traditions, providing participants with the opportunity to learn about Saint Hildegard of Bingen, and Butoh, a meditative Japanese dance form that involves very slow, intense movements. Learn more about Butoh and practice guided imagery and meditative movement techniques that Sindy Butz uses in her own art performances and training.  In celebration of the vernal equinox, end a cold winter with joy and make the transition into spring with consciousness, then enjoy a cup of tea from a recipe inspired by Saint Hildegard.

During the Winter Workspace, Chad Stayrook continues his exploratory narrative video series, creating four short videos that respond to ÛÏplaceÛ featuring an interplanetary explorer who could only survive in cold winter weather.

In his workshop, learn to build sculptures as big as your house with materials you can find in your closet, as Stayrook teaches a technique to bind plastic sheets (garbage bags) together with the use of wax paper and an iron. Each participant will work on his or her own unique shape. At the end, the group will combine all the forms into one giant sculpture that is inflated with a simple fan.

Drawing from ancient meditative practices of Tibet and India, elements of indigenous shamanic traditions, as well as contemporary methods, this event offers a centering and revitalizing experience of sound to support optimal states of physical wellness, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  By experiencing various instruments (including singing bowls, flutes, tuning forks, percussion instruments, chimes, and more) as well as exercising their own voices, participants explore fundamental principles of sound healing and learn how implementing these principles can have a positive impact on their holistic well-being.

It is astonishing what a difference can be made in one's physical well-being, state of mind, and quality of life with the regular exposure to even just a few simple sound healing techniques. 
Drawing from ancient meditative practices of Tibet and India, elements of indigenous shamanic traditions, as well as contemporary methods, this event offers a centering and revitalizing experience of sound to support optimal states of physical wellness, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  By experiencing various instruments (including singing bowls, flutes, tuning forks, percussion instruments, chimes, and more) as well as exercising their own voices, participants explore fundamental principles of sound healing and learn how implementing these principles can have a positive impact on their holistic well-being.

WeÛªre so excited about our new home in the heart of BrooklynÛªs loveliest green space, and hope to have a long friendship with our new partners at the Prospect Park Alliance, the non-profit organization that preserves and maintains Prospect Park.

The new location will be open every Sunday, 11am to 6pm, through October 11, with the same 100 vendors you know and love. We found a beautiful spot called Breeze Hill, which has plenty of room for the market and a shady lawn for hanging out and noshing.

Breeze Hill is just north of the LeFrak Center at Lakeside, and just off the main bike/jogging road across from the Lincoln Road entrance to the park. The closest subway is the Q to Prospect Park, but you can also walk from the F to 15th St. or the 2/3 to Grand Army Plaza. 

Of course we are sad to leave our longtime Sunday home at Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is turning our patch of pavement into beautiful new parkland next year. We hope to have a presence in Brooklyn Heights/DUMBO again sooner than later. Until then, see you in Prospect Park!",0

Evening wear, ball gowns, Venetian masks, suits, and tuxes are what to wear to this high class night of masks and murder. Get ready for a glamorous evening of mystery, intrigue, and murder.

When the signal is given, participants launch their water balloons at the opposite team until another signal is given to stop.

Southern Brooklyn,2014-11-04T00:00:00-0800,"Hello Everyone 
In light of all the negative ads I feel that it is necessary to show support to Domenic Recchia in his campaign against  Michael Grimm
Domenic really is a great Guy, When you are Italians, things don't really come out of our mouths Gracefully don't let that sway your decision that  he is not qualified  When he became a council member he really helped his district. If anyone knows me they would know  that I am no Democrat!! But When Domenic Says he is going to do something he follows through and does not stop until the job is done. If I didn't know Domenic the way I do I would probably be voting for Michael Grimm too. 
While he was Councilman he did these events in the restaurant called THE SENIOR PROMS- He invited all the Senior Citizen in the Synagogues, Churches & Nursing Homes in his district and hired a live Band so the elderly could have a night out. THEY LOVED IT!!! and When we were hit by Hurricane Sandy Domenic used whatever contacts he had to get the Red Cross and Fema set up in MCU parking lot within two days. He begged me to open Gargiulos Restaurant  so we could arrange feeding the people of Coney Island Thanksgiving Dinner, When it was impossible for me to accommodate it. He hired buses to transport the people to and From the El Caribe. I feel the reason he is having a difficult time is because he cares more about the people and less about the politicians.
I can honestly Support Domenic and I know that if he wins He will get the right people in place to get the job done. and we will truly have a partner in Government to bring the resource that we so desperately need. 
                  VOTE FOR Domenic Recchia",1

""Besides having a truly beautiful voice, young NYC songwriter Lynette Williams also possesses the ability to blend beautifully soul, pop and jazz influences. Her debut EP ÛÏSongs For SarahÛ is a surprising first effort, very mature musically and filled with quality tracks."" --Deli Magazine

Harlem-based artist Lynette Williams creates music that is complex and simple, dark and joyful, abstract and tangible ÛÓ sometimes all of that in the space of a single verse. It is at once tragic and joyful, quiet and mighty ÛÓ reserved and abandoned. Lynette sang backgrounds for Ms. Lauryn Hill and is also on Ms. HillÛªs track ÛÏConsumerismÛ. SheÛªs in the 2015 December issue of Essence and was a featured artist at The Apollo in February. Her own band plays around New York at local venues such as Rockwood, Bowery Electric, Lincoln Center, The Highline, The Blue Note, and Pianos. She currently has an EP out called ÛÏSongs for SarahÛ.

The Poofs are nondescript puppet objects which confound reason.  Inspiring wonder from their visitors the poofs simple ARE. They do not speak or react in any coherent manner. They are a cross between plants and insects, anchored to the ground and confounding an impression of rational sentience.

Northwest Brooklyn,2015-10-17T18:00:00-0400,"Graffiti vs Street Art: A History, is an historical exhibition intended to clearly present the fact that, although  being blanketed under the terms Street Art or Urban Art, Graffiti and Street Art are actually two very different things. Simply put, this Graffiti is calligraphic. This Street Art is primarily image based,  or when textual, conceptual. Of course, people have written and drawn on walls ever since the walls were caves, rocks, clay, or just dirt. This exhibit,  concerns popular contemporary urban formats. Inspired by the attention that the calligraphically oriented classic graffiti writers-who adopted self appointed monikers as did the hip hop musicians of the day, a later generation of artists took to the streets in order to take advantage of the exposure the writers had experienced. This show is not a comprehensive overview but a selection of graffiti writers who rose to prominence during its ÛÏgolden eraÛ of the 1970s, and the most prolific street artists who subsequently developed the form from the mid/late Û÷70s through the early 1980s. 
Graffiti vs Street Art: A History, features significant artist from both sides of the coin.  Al Diaz(Bomb One, Samo*) co-curator, selected the following graffiti writers to participate; Samo*, Bomb One, Snake -1, Flint, Jester, Tracy 168, & Lee. The following street artist were selected by co-curator Christopher Hart Chambers(avant*); avant*, Scot Borofsky, Linus Coraggio, Richard Hambleton, Ken Hiratsuka, RV, Dan Witz, & Keith Haring.

*Samo was a duo including Al Diaz and Jean-Michelle Basquiat

Throughout the night we will be auctioning art in an effort to raise money for Art Against Assault.

Art Against Assault Mission: To grant survivors of sexual assault and rape the opportunity to share their experiences through creative means. To honor the anonymity of survivors who wish to remain unidentified and to support those who have the courage to be named. To unite the stories and experiences of survivors and show that our voices are varied and many. To help heal by revealing that every story has a place. To challenge the myths surrounding sexual assault and rape in our communities. To support each other by acknowledging that every experience is unique as well as connected. To invite the public into discourse about the stigmas, myths, and realities surrounding rape in our culture. To encourage government officials and law enforcement to treat survivors of sexual assault and rape with respect and compassion, to view sexual assault and rape as serious offenses worth seeking justice for, and to end the backlog. To end the stigma and silence. To provide much needed funding for regional crisis centers, hotlines, and victim support services through the acceptance of donations for works of art and performances. To suggest that offering a voice to the unspoken realities of our present is the first step to defining a better future.

SIX SIDES OF THE CUBE PRESENTED BY DEUXPIECE OPENS AT THE BISHOP

BROOKLYN, NY (April 22, 2013)ÛÒ The Bishop in collaboration with Deuxpiece will have an opening of a new exhibition called Six Sides of The Cube on Saturday, May 18th 2013 at 6:00PM.

The curatorial collaboration between Bianca Hildenbrand and Whitney Ramage sets out to explore international similarities and differences through the universality of the cube. This
exhibition will feature a variety of genres done by artists, Julie Park (KR), Jesse Gamage (USA), Jack Callahan (USA), Jan Hosteller (CH), Whitney Ramage (USA) and Bianca Hildenbrand (CH).

Six Sides of the Cube is based on the fundamental shape of the cube and its many representations. The cube offers a neutrality that is a key ingredient for work that seeks to
manifest an idea concisely. It is often used as an armature on which the artist can build his thoughts. Its versatility and neutrality are virtues but this form also possesses a true potency all its own. And it is this ineffable quality that makes this simple geometry so inexplicably tied to the human condition. The featured use the cube (consciously or unconsciously) in six remarkably disparate ways reiterating its versatility and serving as a reminder that no matter how complex our modern existence is, we will always return to, and rely on the fundamentals.

For more information about this exhibition please call 703-888-7591.

Veronica Garcia-Melendez is a pianist, vocalist, and composer who originally hails from Washington, D.C. In addition to earning a Master of Music degree from the University of North Texas, she has been teaching and performing for over 10 years. Ms. Veronica became a licensed Kindermusik educator because she believes that musical study can not only enhance a child's scholastic foundation, but also build valuable skills that lead to a happy and healthy life.

About Kindermusik

Offering quality music and movement classes for newborns to 6-year-olds in Brooklyn, Lynbrook, and Long Island City, NY. Listen and move. Play and grow. This is Kindermusik, the most trusted music and movement program for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and young children.

Our program is based on research demonstrating the benefits of music at each stage of a child's development. We start from where your child is, regardless of his age, and provide activities that stimulate his mind, body, and sense of play. 
Research shows that music improves a childÛªs memory, cognitive development, learning skills, and ability to express emotion.  Music makes a child a better learner, teaches self-control, improves coordination, enhances creativity, and inspires a lifetime appreciation of music and movement.
 
-Listening activities help ÛÏtuneÛ a childÛªs ear for improved areas in language and attention skills that ensure early school success.

-Build social skills such as turn-taking and cooperation through group learning.

-Strengthen memory and increase attention span through new songs, stories, and rhymes with sufficient repetition to help children remember what theyÛªve learned.

-Boost vocabulary with a variety of poems, songs and stories.

-Instrument play-alongs develop hand-eye-coordination, physical coordination, and a sense of steady beat to help carry out activities such as using a pair of scissors.

-A multi-sensory approach to teach concepts such as loud and quiet or high and low strengthens the learning.

-Stop-and-go, as well as creative movement and dance activities improve coordination, sequencing, self-control, the ability to follow directions, and plan and guide behavior.

-Child-directed learning happens when children share ideas in class and at home with Home Kits.


Research proves that early integration of music into your childs daily routine means improving his ability to think, reason, create, and express. With Kindermusik, the worldÛªs most respected name in musical learning for nerborns to age 7, you and your child will participate together in every step of the learning process. Music skills to academic skills to life skills.",1

DUMBO, Brooklyn

Curated by Erin Joyce Projects
Artists: Sama Alshaib, Basma Alsharif, Raven Chacon, Nicholas Galanin, Steven J. Yazzie

ÛÏThis Land is Your LandÛ is a six-film video installation that examines the dynamism of diasporic communities, the history of violence against diasporic individuals, and the profane abuse of assaultive power that manifests in governmental policies against immigrant or ÛÏunwantedÛ groups. The topic of this exhibition could not be more timely, with the Syrian Refugee Crisis at hand, and United State Government policy on Native American issues endangering the sovereignty of Native lands. The works in the show range from Nicholas GalaninÛªs examination of the devastating effects of petrol chemical companies invading Native lands, Steven J. YazzieÛªs work looking at the water crisis on Tribal land in Southern Arizona, Raven ChaconÛªs illustrative work on orchestrated violence and the instrumentalization of policy against people, Sama AlshaibÛªs works upon abusive power, and the destruction of environment and bio-location, and Basma AlsharifÛªs illustration of the end of nature. The exhibition, while offering aesthetic beauty, also enters into a pensive dialogue on pressing issues.

Harlem-based artist Lynette Williams creates music that is complex and simple, dark and joyful, abstract and tangible ÛÓ sometimes all of that in the space of a single verse.

It is a privilege and honor from my years of experience to be able to share the knowledge I've obtained from all over the world and techniques I have learned from my teachers with others. I believe in the unbounded power of Yoga to improve the quality of all aspects of students' lives from physical conditioning to the healing of trauma. So whether you are looking to get in better shape, or redirecting a positive flow of energy within your body, I am excited to practice with you. 

This will be a donation based event. 
However, half the proceeds will be going to my friends from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, so feel free to be generous if you can.

Open to all amounts of yoga asana (posture) experience. Particular focus will be placed on synchronizing breath with movement, as well as, customized alignment.

There will also be a short meditation session after this class.

and dynamics of ever changing cityÛÛ_ 

Being just a little child, Anton would express a great interest to the fine art. The inception of that enthusiasm still noted in some of his recent works: the way he conveyed his vision - beautiful strokes of expressionism are mesmerizing
indeed! Especially it is well distinctive in his painting ÛÏPortugalÛªs portÛÏ and ÛÏThe DreamÛ.

After AntonÛªs realization that the Art is his true call, he went to the Russian Academy of Arts in one of the most sophisticated cities ÛÒ St. Petersburg. As any artist, he has a unique way of sharing his thoughts with the world on the canvas. Some of his
life statements certainly have influenced it: ÛÏInspiration is a very elusive phenomenon, you simply have to love the feel of the brush in your hand to keep creatingÛ and ÛÏFearless process of daydreaming and workÛ_Û- that is where we find Realism theme in his works, such as ÛÏA girl with applesÛ, ÛÏThe HuntersÛ.

During his years in Academy Anton has always been very vigorous and diligent. He participated in over a 10 big art competitions that brought him an awards and certain fame. Because of such hard work and talent, part of the artistÛªs paintings were succefully sold to some private house collections in Russia.

As it is appropriate for any artistic spirit, Anton followed his art-fervor to NYC to explore a new horizon, culture and trends. ÛÏOne splendid artist is now walking the streets of ManhattanÛ_Û",1

DIY spaces are an essential part of our culture and allow for free expression, association, and exploration of new ideas outside of an environment fully regulated by law. However, this creates constant difficulties especially as those dwelling in cities face ever increasing prices for both housing, commercial rents, and the investment required to operate fully in compliance with the law.  

99 Sense and RINSED are hosting a benefit for those affected in Oakland and a party where we can gather to celebrate the music and artistic expression that brings us all together and explore how we can move forward as a community to ensure that these spaces can ensure the safety of everyone and prevent withering harrassment from the authorities.

Following the release of his latest album, Potential earlier this year, The Range returns to Good Room. Potential is a record steeped in histories ÛÒ of its characters, of its forebears ÛÒ but is startlingly new and alive: the network may be ones and zeros but the circuitry here runs on blood, still.

James Hinton made the computer his primary instrument after falling under the spell of Baltimore club, bringing in his broader sonic influences from early Û÷90s jungle, early Û÷00s grime and mid Û÷00s electronica to a new sonic whole. The software was the thing at home, but what excited the young producer was the network, and where he spiraled was YouTube. Potential uses as its backbone a series of vocal samples that Hinton has found in the forgotten corners of the site, guiding us around the hinterlands of YouTube, introducing us to unknown artists expressing themselves unfettered by the constraints of industry, lost in the infinite potential of an audience unknown.

He will be joined by Jim-E Stack. Jim-E Stack has always had a knack taking a wild and assorted set of influences and filtering them into a coherent, heartfelt sound. Currently based out of New York, Jim-E Stack perfected his own sound one that synthesizes everything from 90s house to Baltimore club. Initially, Jim-E Stack has built a following on the strength of his early singles and EPs on labels like Body High and Good Years and his remixes for the likes of Sky Ferreira and A$AP Rocky. This year he released two singles, 'Dreamt' and 'Deadstream' as well as a cover of BjÌ¦rk's 'Hyperballad' featuring Lower Dens singer Jana Hunter.

PEARSON SOUND
As one third of the team behind the Hessle Audio label, David KennedyÛªs Pearson Sound moniker has become synonymous with cutting edge UK dancefloor music. Having stripped back his release schedule , somewhat defiantly hitting out with just a couple of self-released singles that hinted at a more vivid approach to his production this year, heÛªs truly taken his DJing global with his performances reaching as far afield as Asia, South America and Australia. Having lectured at the Red Bull Music Academy in Madrid, released a critically heralded FABRICLIVE compilation and remixed artists like Radiohead, The xx and M.I.A., KennedyÛªs also found the time to run the vinyl only club night, Acetate, in Leeds and help ensure that Hessle AudioÛªs weekly radio show on LondonÛªs Rinse FM maintains its role as an essential part of the stationÛªs broadcasting schedule. 

ANTHONY NAPLES
Anthony Naples is a musician and DJ from Miami, Florida, living in New York City. He has released music on Text Records, The Trilogy Tapes, Mister Saturday Night, Rubadub, and runs a record label called Proibito. He has DJÛªed at many great clubs, festivals and most important of all ÛÒ PARTIES in many countries and cities around the world.

SUPPLY RECORDS
Supply Records is an independent electronic label focusing primarily on dance music. The schedule is made up of releases ranging from house to techno and beyond. The label is rooted in all kinds of music and an admiration for artists who are not afraid to play many different styles and influences. Initially started to support the founders' musical projects, the catalog has grown to provide a platform for their friends' music and artists worldwide.

We're celebrating five years of the label in the Bad Room with Berlin techno producer RenÌ© Audiard, label owners B-Tracks, a live melodic techno hardware set from Paul Morse and John Barera & Will Martin.

Marcus Worgull adores the art of moving butts. He spends his weekends on planes and trains (he actually prefers driving a car) to carry a bag of records to prized clubs like Robert Johnson, Fabric, Plastic People, Trouw or Sub Club on the regular. His very own selection of well-made and often newly laid house music that knows its roots as well as it is yearning for the future or explores the leftfield, is what you can expect from him. You can also reappraise his methods (and love for other music) on each of his specifically created and applauded mix shows that float the net. All of this is presented and custom-made for your pleasure with the loving hands of a working DJ.

Paris born, Tokyo raised NYC based international eclectic french DJ, producer and international co-ordinator. He makes music as Tokyo Black Star with his partner Isao Kumano and runs the World Famous NYC record label. Since moving back to NYC he's become a stalwart of the scene and a Good Room regular. Alex's encyclopedic knowledge of music translates on the dancefloor, keeping butts moving to disco and house for hours and hours on end.

Free afterparty from midnight

Tickets at: http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1381225

Chairlift
Critically acclaimed pop duo Chairlift has released new music in the form of the infinitely danceable ÛÏCh-Ching.Û The R&B laced, vibrating drum infused pop track serves as the first musical offering from their forthcoming album Moth, which was released in January 2016 via Columbia Records. Although the single is the first work to be released from Chairlift in three years, the duo ÛÒ comprised of writer/producers and multi-instrumentalists Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly ÛÒ has hardly been quiet. They collaborated with BeyoncÌ© on her groundbreaking self-titled album via the track ÛÏNo Angel,Û which was written and produced by Caroline and co-produced by Patrick. Caroline released and toured Arcadia, a self-produced solo album under the alias Ramona Lisa and collaborated with SBTRKT, Blood Orange and others, while Patrick produced and collaborated with artists such as Solange Knowles, Wet, Kelela, and Tei Shi.

An evolution from their last album, 2012Ûªs Something, Moth proves to be an emotionally uninhibited and markedly stronger, more pop inspired body of work. A very New York City inspired album, listeners can expect to be led through an aural mix of big, rich pop inspired hooks, vibrating bass, lively brass and sensuous R&B inspired vocals, all anchored in the duoÛªs meticulously crafted instrumentation.

Mr Twin Sister
""Twin Sister are a Brooklyn-by-way-of-Long Island quintet that do so much so well. Their songs have a remarkable sense of atmosphere and romanticism. They nod at their heroes-- maybe Stereolab and Bjork, maybe Cocteau Twins or 1980s pop-- without overtly stealing. They seem to know they are capable of great things..."" - Pitchfork

The band's self-titled album is the second full length album by the five members of Twin Sister, now known as Mr Twin Sister. Following their debut LP, composed largely in a studio, the band returned to the creative process they had employed on their first two EPs- working individually or in small, shifting groups. Ideas germinated in an environment where experimentation was encouraged. Some bloomed immediately, others matured slowly over the years, the rest demolished and rebuilt dozens of times in an effort to discover their ideal form. Progress was slow, coming in fits and bursts, accommodating the unexpected twists and turns of life.

Junglepussy
Brooklyn rapper Junglepussy, known for her fiery lyrics that pack a punch and her unapologetic attitude, first started making music at the end of 2012. Since then sheÛªs released two projects, Satisfaction Guaranteed and Pregnant with Success, given talks at Yale, Columbia, and NYU, licensed her music for Comedy CentralÛªs Broad City, and walked in the DKNY fashion show. She's been cosigned by everyone from Diddy and Erykah Badu to Action Bronson and Le1f, and played shows with Lil Kim, Nelly Furtato, Travis Scott, Solange, and Dev Hynes. ÛÏJunglepussy means business, and sheÛªs got the talent to back it up. With a raw sexuality and a strong message about female autonomy and empowerment, sheÛªs a modern Lil Kim.Û",1

in the Bad Room

Tickets - $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the door

Doors - 11pm / +21 gig

METRO AREA
The brainchild of veteran producers Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani, Metro Area was born out of the pairÛªs somewhat dichotomous love for both the classic moods of R&B, disco and boogie and innovative, modern dance music.  Metro Area brings back the soulful experimentation of the early club classics, mixing live and electronic instruments.  Simultaneously, the mood and minimalism of more recent forms creep into the mix: Detroit's cold futurism, Chicago's abstract track-modes, the warmth of New York and New Jersey's deep house and the experimentation of brave pop music.  All of these influences combine with the duoÛªs unique perspective to create a distinctive sound that is unmistakably their own.

BENOIT & SERGIO
Benoit & Sergio produce dance songs that sometimes seem like musical open letters; editorials narrated in the voices of unidentified, yet totally recognizable colorful characters, read aloud against a backdrop of beautifully lush, warm and sensuous electronic pop music. The French/US duo met at an after party in Berlin, and it wasnÛªt long before their signature combination of rich synth work combined with pop influenced lyrical magic and impressive songwriting had been released on labels such as Spectral Sound, DFA, Visionquest, Hot Creations and Culprit.

JUSTIN MILLER
Justin Miller is a quintessential New York City DJ. Mixing the classically cool with the always-cool and the brand new, heÛªs a selector whose tastes spread across best of techno, deep house, and disco new and old. Part of that diversity likely comes from his tenure as DFA Records assistant label manager and sole employee for seven years, guiding the seminal NYC label through one of its most fruitful periods. After leaving DFA he started Have A Killer Time Recordings and is now the head of Deus Records.

THE ALMOND BROTHERS
An accident turned happy when their nut roasting carts convened outside the fabled Mangiami many moons ago.  Three long lost brothers decided to team up and take their veritable idiot circus around the world for schnitz and wiggles.  Put on your party hats because it's never a dull moment when these nuts drop the jams.",1

RYAN ELLIOTT
Ryan Elliott's sound remains unchanged: bassline-driven techno and house reduced to their essence, thoughtfully calibrated to drive crowds out of their minds. The time is right, the tracks are right, and Ryan Elliott is exactly where he needs to be. Elliott, whose distinction as an internationally respected DJ, remixer, and one-half of Spectral SoundÛªs A&R team, has grown steadily over his decade-plus behind the decks. They donÛªt hand out ÛÏDJÛªs DJÛ reputations at the club door, and ElliottÛªs is well-earned and well-deserved. Influenced by his hometown staples (Axis, Purpose Maker, M Plant, and UR) along with international labels like Perlon, Playhouse, and early Kompakt, Ryan inhabits his kick drums, becoming an extension of the music and vice versa.

MIGUEL SENQUIZ
Detroit native Miguel Senquiz has artfully crafted a unique voice from a rich musical background. With roots firmly established in the gravitas of the areaÛªs heritage, heÛªs incorporated a unique soulful texture and a polished-but-scuffed aesthetic aided in part by his connection to the Ghostly family. Growing up and seeing legends like Richie Hawtin, Delano Smih and Derrick Carter, HeÛªs used that experience and knowledge to hone in on his own sound, gaining a reputation for long and energetic sets threading, and sometimes blurring the lines of house, techno, and acid.

PARRISH SMITH
Parrish Smith crafts a sound thatÛªs both familiar and deeply inexplicable. Hovering between body music, electronica and deep-burning jakbeat yet rejecting the conventions of all three, his output is as elusive as it is absorbing. Inspired by personal experiences and his determination to keep evolving, Smith developed a distinctive sound derived from an all-analogue set-up, sampling every object that produces sound.

Facets 
in the Bad Room

LindstrÌüm
Like one of his endlessly building tracks, Hans-Peter LindstrÌüm is only moving further upwards. The Norwegian space-disco wizardÛªs new EP, Windings, is three tracks of that now-classic sound closely associated with LindstrÌümÛªs name: skyward synths, effervescent rhythms, and melodies that spiral beautifully into the great unknown. This is LindstrÌüm in the zoneÛÓand if youÛªve been paying close attention over the last decade, itÛªs a zone heÛªs never left.

Recorded over the past year, Windings represents LindstrÌümÛªs latest crystallization of the aesthetic that the greater world was introduced to on the 2006 compilation ItÛªs a Feedelity Affair, as well as the tangy pop of 2012Ûªs masterful Smalhans. This isnÛªt to say LindstrÌümÛªs repeating himselfÛÓfar from it, in fact. Windings finds our arpeggiator-obsessed hero refining an aesthetic that already sounded perfectÛÓa zenith that, much like the music itself, hits new peaks even when it seems that thereÛªs no more ceiling to breach.

Joakim
Since his beginnings in 1999, Joakim has taken great efforts to avoid being pigeonholed and has grown on the outskirts of the French Touch and international Club scenes, becoming one of their major players and an ever surprising outsider. Year after year, Joakim has gathered experiences that confirm his global vision of music and explored many facets of the musical spectrum: a musician with five albums under his belt; a label founder and manager (the fantastic Tigersushi and the recent vinyl-only Crowdspacer imprint)

From Fantoíâmes in 2003, deviating house music from the end of the 90Ûªs, to Nothing Gold in 2011, a vision of pop music as defined by the DFA label, and the more cerebral, frosty and metallic Monsters & Silly Songs in 2006, Joakim has left his fingerprints on current electro, modernizing and hybridizing it, with no concern for schools and genres, taking his inspiration from new wave as well as krautrock, noise and disco, soul and pop, ambient and house.

Barbie Bertisch
Born & raised in Buenos Aires, Brooklyn resident Barbie Bertisch emerged with a passion for genre-bending dance music. Her ever-growing record collection ranges from ambient, fusion & crossover jazz, latin grooves with a flair for afrobeat, cosmic, left-field, house and soulful disco delight. She is also a frequent collaborator on dance music zine Love Injection, co-hosts its monthly namesake radio show on Dublab, has a weekly show on The Lot Radio, and is part of NYC's Classic Album Sundays family.

Naduve
Naduve is the already told story of an Indie rock Accordion player turned on acid into an Analog Synth pornographer. After a boot camp as the resident DJ at the late MICHATRONIX nano club and DJing as a regular at Tel AvivÛªs clubs like The Block, Bootleg, Breakfast Club and many more, he is about to release his new works on labels like Cocktail DÛªamore and Disco Halal. Apart from that nonsense he also takes place in the 84%Creativity (of Malka Tuti label) collective who took the mission of bringing joy the darkest corners of Tel Aviv and His live project - (Shame On Us) along with Yovav Arzi and Alek Lee.

Saturday November 26th No Agenda and Good Room present TrÌ_ SkÌ_l for its second installment of the new residency at the Brooklyn music staple.  This night brings a long overdue debut from Detroit, making their first appearance in New York City with a much heralded Live PA, we are delighted to host Aux88.  Their history spans from the present back to the mid 80s when Tommy Hamilton was working with Juan Atkins on various projects with the seminal Metroplex imprint, 430 West, and with Keith Tucker, their own Puzzlebox Records. In the mid 90s, following forays into solo projects, Aux88 reformed to the present day incarnation.  Their bass heavy electro is a definitively Detroit sound.  In recent years the duo has made several key appearances at international festivals including Dekmantel, Movement, and Awakenings.  Their performance is not to be missed. 
Chicago native Justin Long adds his talents to the bill with an all vinyl set.  Smart Bar Chicago's senior resident hosts one of the city's most heralded underground events, Hugo Ball, which champions exclusively all vinyl sets and caters to the dancefloor, not the Internet.  As a producer, Long has recently embarked on his collaborative project on Brooklyn Imprint LIES, Circling Vultures with Ken Zawacki that debuted earlier this year. As one of the most dynamic and creative Djs from the Windy City, we are honored to have him for this event. 
TrÌ_ SkÌ_l founder  Kimyon rounds out the lineup in the Good Room. He has been busy in the studio with recent releases on Metroplex and a remix on Crosstown Rebels, both appearing this year.  His imprint No Agenda releases its first EP before the end of the year, a 12 inch featuring local siren Bridgit Barkan.  
The Bad Room hosts Lauren Flax, the Detroit native and Brooklyn transplant, who is celebrating her upcoming release on Nervous Records.

Love Tempo in the Bad Room with
Justin Strauss & DJ Billy Caldwell

KEVIN SAUNDERSON
Platinum-selling recording artist, label boss, festival promoter, true innovator in the pantheon of popular music, cultural champion, cracking DJ: thereÛªs a lot to be said about Kevin Saunderson. His influence runs deep, through both adopted hometown of Detroit, and music culture as a whole: as one of the Belleville Three, the high school trio which also includes Juan Atkins and Derrick May, he irreparably changed the face of electronic music; with Inner City, he gave it some of its most memorable tunes.

His nickname of Û÷The ElevatorÛª is apt: for his role in transporting DetroitÛªs new sound to a wider audience; as anyone who has seen him perform live can attest, his high-energy, high-spirit and high-impact DJ sets; and for spending the past 35 years of his life progressing the culture he helped create. Operating in tandem to his golden run as a producer in the late 80s and early 90s, SaundersonÛªs own KMS record label ÛÒ a remarkable 30 years strong in 2017 ÛÒ has chronicled the early footsteps of R-Tyme, Blake Baxter, MK, Chez Damier, Derrick Carter, Bicep and even SaundersonÛªs son and regular DJ partner Dantiez more recently.

CONTAKT
Initially introduced to techno and house by witnessing awe inspiring sets from Detroit hometown heroes such as BMG, Mike Clark, and Robert Hood at illegal parties around Michigan, Contakt has quietly smuggled the Motor CityÛªs refusal to stick to just one of those two genres to NYC via his floor-filling DJ sets, co-founding and curating the forward thinking Brooklyn club night TURRBOTAXå¨, and producing 12Ûs for labels like Argot, Icee Hot, and Local Action that refuse to be categorized in a single genre. 

LOVE TEMPO
Good Room residents Love Tempo are back in the Bad Room for a night of Balearic, house, acid, cosmic, new wave, disco and whatever else they pull out of their record bags. The night will be helmed by to legends of the scene, Justin Strauss and Billy Caldwell.

Justin Strauss has spent more than three decades at the forefront of the NYC dance scene. Starting as DJ at New YorkÛªs legendary Mudd Club, he spun his way through The Ritz, Limelight, Area, Tunnel, M.K., Life, Centro Fly and more, pioneering his own distinctive sound, and becoming one of the most sought-after remixers and producers not just in New York, but in the world. Billy Caldwell made his name at Manchester U.Ks legendary HOME , Hacienda & Paradise Factory ClubsÛª as well as co founding and DJing at the Infamous 'Epping Walk After Hours' Party in his native Manchester England.

For our November sessions we will be looking back at one of the most influential albums of the nineties Irish rock band My Bloody ValentineÛªs second studio album Loveless. We'll be playing the original pressing by Creation Records. 

Coming at a cost of å£250,000 Loveless pushed Alan McGeeÛªs Creation Records to financial breaking point and also pushed the band themselves to the edge with personal disputes and relationship breakdowns all occurring along the way. Perhaps it was worth it as Kevin Shields quest for perfection and boundless faith ultimately served him well as Loveless is revered as not only the magnum opus of Û÷ShoegazeÛª but as one of the greatest rock albums ever created.

Join us as we celebrate Loveless in style with album listening sessions around the world and experience My Bloody Valentine in a way you never have before.

Damon Palermo has been making adventurous house and disco music under the moniker Magic Touch since August 2011. In a short time the producer/DJ has amassed an impressive following and several well-received releases, kicking off with the critically-lauded 100% Silk release ""I Can Feel The Heat,"" which was a recommended release of the week at Boomkat and made 20JazzFunkGreats Best of 2011 list.

Oscilloscope Laboratories Presents: RARE EXPORTS: A CHRISTMAS TALE

It's the eve of Christmas in northern Finland, and an 'archeological' dig has just unearthed the real Santa Claus. But this particular Santa isn't the one you want coming to town. When the local children begin mysteriously disappearing, young Pietari and his father Rauno, a reindeer hunter by trade, capture the mythological being and attempt to sell Santa to the misguided leader of the multinational corporation sponsoring the dig. Santa's elves, however, will stop at nothing to free their fearless leader from captivity. What ensues is a wildly humorous nightmare ÛÒ a fantastically bizarre polemic on modern day morality.

In an interview with The Village Voice before the release of their last album, Monogold told the Internet ""We're a fucking rock band."" Since the release of 2015's ""Good Heavens"", which was Monogold's acoustic-based effort, they have torn down any preconceived notions that they or anyone else had of them. After completely stripping down their sound for ""Good Heavens"", the Monogold boys took this new foundation of simplicity and started building with their signature, catchy power-trio melodies and hooks. They still like to go deep on the lush soundscapes, but their songs have become a bit more focused and driven by the instrumentation and the vocals. 

With their new EP, Kelly, Apuzzo, and Falotico are giving the world a small taste of what is to come in the future of the band. The four song EP is a prelude to another full length record which is in the process of being mixed right now. As with their new found musical simplicity, the lyrical content will tackle the simple things: breastfeeding, giving birth, being born, fucking, bugs, and of course, penises and vaginas meeting for the first time. There's about two albums worth of songs written, and Monogold couldn't bear to keep them to themselves anymore!

This year, Mark took first place at the Great American Comedy Festival competition. In 2013 won CarolineÛªs March Madness competition, beating out 63 other comedians. And this is a real shocker for all of us, but he was also voted Village VoiceÛªs ÛÏBest Comedian of 2013Û, I know, right? In 2012, Mark appeared on ÛÏJohn OliverÛªs New York Standup ShowÛ on Comedy Central, and in 2011 was picked as one of Comedy CentralÛªs ÛÏComics to Watch.Û

Mark was born and raised in New Orleans, LA surprisingly to two normal parents. As a kid he spent most of his time shooting short films and wetting the bed. He started doing comedy right after college and quickly moved to New York. Mark now does comedy clubs and colleges across the country and has been involved in many festivals including Portland, Seattle, DC, Boston, Vancouver, Melbourne and in 2013 was featured as a New Face at the Montreal Comedy Festival.

More annoying accolades that no one really cares about: Mark was named one of Comedy CentralÛªs Comics To Watch for the 2011 New York Comedy Festival. Mark was also named EsquireÛªs ÛÏBest New Comedians 2012Û, SplitsiderÛªs ÛÏTop 10 Up and Coming Comedians on Each CoastÛ, and Time Out New YorkÛªs ÛÏ21 New York Comedy Scene LinchpinsÛ. And he regularly opens for Amy Schumer in small venues like Madison Square Garden.

Try looking backwards and forwards at the same time. Okay, stop tryingÛÓ youÛªre going to hurt yourself. Let The Hollows do it for you. TheyÛªre fully aware that theyÛªre standing on the shoulders of giants, and theyÛªre blazing a path ahead with the musical equivalent of a flamethrower. These frontiersmen of the New York City roots-rock scene have been creating an old sound that sounds newÛÓ or maybe the other way aroundÛÓ since 2009.
When you first see The Hollows take the stage, you will find them out of place. They will appear to be a ragtag set of traveling performers, accustomed to closing out barn dances and just as likely to steal your prize-winning cow as to wake up next to your sister in a hayloft. It will seem to you that they woke up, one confused morning, to find themselves instead on a Brooklyn street corner.
But when the first notes reach your ears, whether from a sweet and breezy mandolin, a whiskey-tuned banjo, or an unrepentant guitar, it will seem to you that the sound of The Hollows is uniquely New York: a contradictory, harmonic melting pot that takes all of its roots, twists them around, and produces something else, something new. This scruffy ensemble of multi-instrumentalists, made up of Justin Aaronson, Jeffrey Kurtze, Daniel Kwiatkowski, Rob Morrison, David Paarlberg, and Erik Saxvik, might just as soon swap glockenspiels, trumpets, and harmonicas as plug in a squawking electric guitar or an airy, spacey synthesizer. The result is a veritable junkyard of instruments and musical personalities, a carnival on wheels, a one-man band in six bodies that owns the stage with all the mobile, rhythmic ease of a seasoned railroad gang.
When The Hollows first began performing together, they quickly produced a diverse output of material that attracted a local following through several monthly residencies at PeteÛªs Candy Store, the intimate, longtime Brooklyn venue that served as a launch pad for acts like Will Oldham, Devendra Banhart, Dirty Projectors, and many more. As word spread, the crowds grew, the venues grew to match, and in 2011, The Hollows captured the attention of audiences and reviewers alike with their debut release, Belong to the Land.  Critics called the album, recorded at The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY, an ÛÏoutstanding offeringÛ made by ÛÏmaster craftsmen,Û ÛÏbrilliantly executedÛ_ a joy to listen to,Û an ÛÏincredible debut effort,Û and simply ÛÏa monster.Û  The bandÛªs artistic production moved beyond the musical with the release of their first video, ÛÏPoor Eyes,Û in 2012, and the song was later highlighted in the soundtrack to Bob GiraldiÛªs short film ÛÏA Poet Long AgoÛ in 2013.  (Additional tracks from Belong to the Land also appear in the 2013 feature film Twenty Million People and 2014Ûªs Sun Belt Express.)
Less than a year later, the band continued its ÛÏmassive momentumÛ with the release of a self-titled EP, tracked at BrooklynÛªs Grand Street Recording and Galaxy Smith Studios, and featured on Spinner, The Huffington Post, MSN, WCBS FM, and MP3.com. A second music video, ÛÏAugust,Û premiered a few months later.  By now, the band was known for its ÛÏecstatic live showsÛ and the ÛÏmelodic, fiery hoedownÛ they inspired, which prompted the release of a live album, Neverending Show, in 2013: a ÛÏfresh breath of true musician spritÛ that offered a ÛÏsoulful, powerful and thick soundÛ and captured ÛÏeverything that makes seeing The Hollows live in concert so much fun.Û
On June 3rd, The Hollows will release their second full-length album, Between the Water and the Wonder Wheel, tracked at The Bunker in Brooklyn with producer John Siket [Sonic Youth, Phish, Yo La Tengo, Dave Matthews Band], engineered by James Frazee [Beck, Patti Smith, Esperanza Spalding], and mastered by Fred Kevorkian [Willie Nelson, Ryan Adams, The White Stripes].  It kicks off with ÛÏMountains to the Sea,Û an anthemic blend of folk and raw electricity that catapults the listener into the rest of the album, which is at times thoughtful and meditative; others rollicking and boisterous.  ÛÏJamestown,Û with its soaring classic rock sensibility, hits hard.  ÛÏHumpback HeartÛ will make you want to drive a pickup across the country, only to get out and dance on the side of the road.  ÛÏCross Country CallÛ and ÛÏMidnight BandÛ seem to channel ghosts.   ÛÏThe Ballad of Jack and ViÛ is a love song with a range and ambition that could only come from The Hollows, with a crooked cast of characters and a sonic atmosphere that whisks you through the rivers and backwoods of Americana.  The final track, ÛÏPioneers,Û rises slowly from the earth and burns up into the night sky, the ashes fading like a daybreak dream.
This summer, The Hollows will hit the ground running with their first national tour, with 30 shows announced in 20 states, and more on the way. When you catch them in action, youÛªll see an unpredictable barn-burner full of high-octane foot-stomping and exuberant odes to love on the rocks, life on the lam, death on the road, and the fact that thereÛªs still a place in music where fallen angels, risen devils, and even the seediest of back bar characters can all live together in six-part harmony.  YouÛªll dive into the flood and awake drenched the next morning, with a fire in your belly and a song in your headÛÓ surprised to find you had a hootenanny hidden in your toes.

https://www.facebook.com/goldenchildband
Brooklyn-based, Florida-born songwriters Wiley Gaby & Jeffrey Doker set out to carve a space where their seemingly disparate influences could meet, mingle, and ultimately blur genre lines to create beautiful new music. Influenced by classic country storytelling, melancholy pop melodies, and pretty things, the duo formed Goldenchild in the spring of 2014, and will release their debut album, Bridges, this fall.With a handful of original tunes ready to record, Doker & Gaby tapped rock producer/engineer Mark Ephraim, whose previous credits include work with The New Pornographers, Ed Vallance, & Au Revoir Simone, to name a few. EphraimÛªs darker production paired with the songwritersÛª country-influenced melodies yielded a haunting, evocative, and more rock-tinged sound.Joined by a stellar roster of guest players such as Parker Kindred (Antony & The Johnsons, Joan As Policewoman, Jeff Buckley) on drums, Jon Rauhouse (Neko Case) & Ed Kurz (Tatter & Rags) on pedal steel, Caleb Lindskoog (The Silver State, Magmana) on electric guitar, and many others, Ephraim and GoldenchildÛªs core personnelÛÓGaby, Doker, guitarist Jeff Mensch, vocalist Kerry Flanagan, and multi-instrumentalist James PowerÛÓrecorded Bridges throughout north Brooklyn between 2014 and 2015. On their debut album, Goldenchild merges elements of classic country and ambient soundscapes with a respectable hint of pop sensibility. The result is ÛÏgorgeous, cosmic countryÛ that NYCÛªs Next magazine calls ÛÏdamn beautiful.Û

Boys and girls compete separately in three different age groups 9-10, 11-12, and 13-14.

The Jr. NBA Skills Challenge is a 45-second competition that begins with zig-zag dribbling around cones followed by speed dribbling.  Participants will then have the remaining time to shoot from designated spots on the court, with made shots earning different point values based on their difficulty.  After the 45 seconds is complete, participants will shoot one free throw for bonus points.

A champion from each gender and age group (9-10, 11-12, and 13-14) from every local competition will advance to the regional competitions (May 8-June 5) held in Atlanta, Chicago, Connecticut, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. They will be eligible to receive t-shirts, awards nad potentially team/ sponsor related items.

The top 18 regional competition champions (three winners from each age and gender group) will receive an all-expense-paid trip to New York City to participate in the National Finals (June 22-24).

and dynamics of ever changing cityÛÛ_ 

Being just a little child, Anton would express a great interest to the fine art. The inception of that enthusiasm still noted in some of his recent works: the way he conveyed his vision - beautiful strokes of expressionism are mesmerizing
indeed! Especially it is well distinctive in his painting ÛÏPortugalÛªs portÛÏ and ÛÏThe DreamÛ.

After AntonÛªs realization that the Art is his true call, he went to the Russian Academy of Arts in one of the most sophisticated cities ÛÒ St. Petersburg. As any artist, he has a unique way of sharing his thoughts with the world on the canvas. Some of his
life statements certainly have influenced it: ÛÏInspiration is a very elusive phenomenon, you simply have to love the feel of the brush in your hand to keep creatingÛ and ÛÏFearless process of daydreaming and workÛ_Û- that is where we find Realism theme in his works, such as ÛÏA girl with applesÛ, ÛÏThe HuntersÛ.

During his years in Academy Anton has always been very vigorous and diligent. He participated in over a 10 big art competitions that brought him an awards and certain fame. Because of such hard work and talent, part of the artistÛªs paintings were succefully sold to some private house collections in Russia.

As it is appropriate for any artistic spirit, Anton followed his art-fervor to NYC to explore a new horizon, culture and trends. ÛÏOne splendid artist is now walking the streets of ManhattanÛ_Û",1

DIY spaces are an essential part of our culture and allow for free expression, association, and exploration of new ideas outside of an environment fully regulated by law. However, this creates constant difficulties especially as those dwelling in cities face ever increasing prices for both housing, commercial rents, and the investment required to operate fully in compliance with the law.  

99 Sense and RINSED are hosting a benefit for those affected in Oakland and a party where we can gather to celebrate the music and artistic expression that brings us all together and explore how we can move forward as a community to ensure that these spaces can ensure the safety of everyone and prevent withering harrassment from the authorities.

Sunset Park,2013-10-18T18:00:00-0400,"In two weeks, hordes of talented up-and-coming musicians will invade New York City to perform and party during CMJ 2013. And in honor of the slew of collective festivities, Baeble is kicking off its annual CMJ weekend shindig at Spike Hill in Brooklyn. If you aren't familiar with our little concert series, allow us to refresh your memories. It's free to enter (if you're old enough to booze that is); you get 12 or more concerts over the span of two nights; and the 4-buck brews flow like the salmon of Capistrano. Spike Hill is only steps off the Bedford Ave. L stop, so you won't even have to deal with any of that riff-raff.

This year's Launch Pad will host some of CMJ's buzziest bands, and we're thrilled to announce the lineup for the weekend: 

FRIDAY OCTOBER 18TH 
7PM: Flagship 
8PM: Duologue 
9PM: The Darcys

Ok, here are the details.

Our flagship vodka was given a fresh redesign inspired by the city that we call home and we want to throw a party to celebrate. But, of course that's not all.

A few months ago, Industry City Distillery partnered up with Kristen Walther Photography (kristenwaltherphotography.com)  and Moonweasel Productions to shoot our first ever advertising campaign. Shot with a luscious art deco feel, we're really looking forward to showing it off for the first time! The cast and crew will be there so feel free to say hi!

So rather than just have a regular party, we're throwing a 1920's themed party! Dress to impress - flapper dresses and all modern takes on 20's gear highly encouraged (but of course not mandatory).

RAYA BRASS BAND since 2008 Raya Brass Band has energized clubs, international festivals, rooftop parties, and subway cars with its hard-driving, original brass band music. The six members of the band bring their unique voices to the group, creating a sound informed as much by their love for the fierce and seductive music of the Balkans as it is by New Orleans brass bands, punk rock, and global music. Featuring trumpet, sax, accordion, tuba, and percussion, this band wails, sweats, and shouts alongside its audience.

There's a problem in America that has always been here - in systemic racism and institutionalized discrimination- we support black liberation through Black Lives Matter. 

We also believe in dismantling the system that unfairly concentrates wealth- we believe Occupy Wall Street is still viable in that education and dissent.

TIPSY OXCART plays electric, sweaty, bumpin Balkan music, channeling the spirit of 36 hour weddings to keep the crowds dancing until the sun comes up. Serving up originals and fresh, upbeat arrangements of urban dance tunes, the band deviously infuses the sounds of South-Eastern Europe with elements of funk, rock, and jazz. Dig naughty violin solos, atomic accordion grooves, freak-out clarinet, and the baddest rhythm section this side of the Mediterranean. A party with Tipsy Oxcart is guaranteed to shake the dance floor all night long!

EMPEROR NORTON'S STATIONARY MARCHING BAND combines the rich musical history of the circus and the vagabond peoples of Europe with the raw energy of avant-garde jazz, the burning heat of funk and the irreverence and fun of todays Vaudeville for a sound that is somehow familiar yet like no other. Label them anyway you like! Call them avant world fusion, call them experimental big band, call them gypsy steamfunk, call them circus noise! They may be tough to sum up, but its easy to tell you theyll show you a good time and theyll get a crowd dancing!

The band's members come from internationally touring ensembles like John Brown's Body and Itzhak Perlman and bring a blend of dance music with stellar improvisation and melodies that evoke crazy dancing, contemplative thoughts and good times.

FUNKRUST BRASS BAND is a twenty-piece brass band founded and led by songwriter, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Phil Andrews (Rude Mechanical Orchestra, Gay Panic, Apocalypse Five & Dime). Funkrust was born in a basement in Ridgewood, Queens in November of 2014. Their sound stems from a unique blend of punk, disco, EDM, metal, funk, Balkan brass and New Orleans second line.

A familiar face to many from the runway to the art scene, Ibrahim Baaith has made quite an impression throughout his modeling & art careers, appearing on billboards, editorials and campaigns to TV commercials, music videos and even a Disney Channel film aside of child star Kyle Massey. 

Ibrahim is often seen painting live at music and art events throughout NYC and creating a most famous landmark mural of OlÛª Dirty BastardÛªs classic album cover in Bedstuy. 

The Philadelphian native also starred in a docu-series entitled ÛÏModel CityÛ, which aired on both BET and Centric and has received international acclaim with his artistic talents. Model City allowed Ibrahim to reach a wider audience and integrate his world of fashion with his longtime passion for the arts. 


While being nominated for awards in Urban Fashion to being a ÛÏDo-GooderÛ, a Brooklyn based award for those who are pioneers and leaders in their community, he finds time to explore his passion for teaching and mentoring children, and has been the art instructor for the LilÛª RaggaMuffin Summer Camp since 2012, a mentor of the BMI (Black Male Initiative) of CUNY , and also a participant in Groundswell Murals, an organization aiming to guide NYCÛªs at-risk youth into developing their careers and discovering their passions.",1

Join us on THURSDAY APRIL 30TH for our two year anniversary party from 6pm til late. We have sponsors PBR and Reyka Vodka in the house helping us kick stat the party, our Head Chef Milton cooking up some tasty appetizers and a new artist launching his newest work at Sweet Science. 

Amar Stewart recreates history through oil paintings inspired by The Dutch Masters such as Frans Hals, Rembrandt, and Van Dyke and forges a powerful and appealing dichotomy between 17th centuryÛªs European elite to paragon musicians and superstars of our time. They connect to create a classical take on royalty in the 21st century. His world is a transcendence of time in an ethereal method asking questions of what is considered royalty today.",1

Consent is when someone agrees, gives permission, or says ""yes"" to sexual activity with other persons. Consent is always freely given and all people in a sexual situation must feel that they are able to say ""yes"" or ""no"" or stop the sexual activity at any point.

Consent can be defined  as ""a clear and unambiguous agreement, expressed outwardly through mutually understandable words or actions, to engage in a particular activity."" Consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point. Consent must be voluntarily given and may not be valid if a person is being subjected to actions or behaviors that elicit emotional, psychological, physcial, reputational, financial pressure, threat, intimidation, or fear (coercion or force). Consent to engage in one sexual activity, or past agreement to engage in a particular sexual activity, cannot be presumed to constitute consent to engage in a different sexual activity or to engage again in a sexual activity. Consent cannot be validly given by a person who is incapacitated. 

At the heart of consent is the idea that every person has a right to personal sovereignty ÛÒ the right to not be acted upon by someone else in a sexual manner unless they give that person clear permission.  It is the responsibility of the person initiating the sexual activity to get this permission. 

Consent should not be assumed.

Respect other patrons personal space.",1

an evening of poets, performance, and music

Wednesday, Dec 7
Doors at 7:30 PM / Begins at 8:30 PM

Featuring:

The legendary poet Sara Deniz Akant

The dress up ritual induced its practitioner to a state of possession, whereby the language of the third presence, a battery operated companion doll, was reencoded into American English. Legendary performances now raise these outputs from the book's pages into the air.

The legendary performer Andy Braddock

A complex of potentials marked from its youth for media archaeology is confounded by what has been unearthed and already underway. A practiced body gradually discloses its own processes to itself, always pre-individually seeking its own vanquishment.

The legendary poet Joey Yearous-Algozin

Corrupt and incomplete analysis of the foundational bedrock caused the bridge to collapse, and the troll has escaped. It's on them that the people, immersed in vats of Dissipative Imperial Playlist, cannot realize that this is what's happening to them, and are incapable of saying, ""the troll has escaped.""

The legendary musicians Carolyn Hietter and Sydney Viles

While the theremin translates cartesian positionality into sombre quanta, the saxophone gazes into the diaphragm to find its definition. The musicians belonging to these instruments discovered each other at the ever mysterious NYC Constellation Ensemble.

Now announcing joining this astonishing bill:

Carolyn Hietter, saxophonist 
and 
Sydney Viles, thereminist!

Imagine your own oblique description for these two legendary performers!",1

////////////////////////With Maggie Gaster spinning records//////////////////////////////
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Hosted by Nick Walther\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


Road Trips, a memoir by Tamim Ansary, recounts stories from his years as part of the American Û÷60s and Û÷70s counterculture, after he arrived from Afghanistan where he was born and raised. The book revolves around three arduous journeys he launched from his home base in Portland, Oregon, between 1969 and 1975.  The stories unfold against the familiar background of communes and collectives, Woodstock and Watergate, sex, dope, acid, rockÛªnÛªroll, and the end of civilization as we know it, but at heart this is not a history of those all too-well-chronicled times; itÛªs a mythic private story of which we all have some idiosyncratic version of our own: the passage from wonderstruck childhood through tortured adulthood to contemplative old age.",0

4. Blood Orange Hibiscus Leisure Time - Wheat lager brewed with a spice blend of lemongrass, coriander, chamomile, and orange peel, then infused with hibiscus and blood orange. 4.8% 

5. Barrel Aged Framinghammer Italiano - Baltic porter aged in bourbon barrels. Big, bold, and black.

With star anise,lemon peel,and espresso. 10%

6. Maibock Hurts Like Helles- deep golden maibock with an intense malty almost grape-like aroma and flavor. A light noble hop character balances the smooth sweet finish. A long lagering time makes this beer exceptionally drinkable for its strength. 6.5%",0

Ibrahim is often seen painting live at music and art events throughout NYC and creating a most famous landmark mural of OlÛª Dirty BastardÛªs classic album cover in Bedstuy. 

The Philadelphian native also starred in a docu-series entitled ÛÏModel CityÛ, which aired on both BET and Centric and has received international acclaim with his artistic talents.

Consent is when someone agrees, gives permission, or says ""yes"" to sexual activity with other persons. Consent is always freely given and all people in a sexual situation must feel that they are able to say ""yes"" or ""no"" or stop the sexual activity at any point.

Consent can be defined  as ""a clear and unambiguous agreement, expressed outwardly through mutually understandable words or actions, to engage in a particular activity."" Consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point. Consent must be voluntarily given and may not be valid if a person is being subjected to actions or behaviors that elicit emotional, psychological, physcial, reputational, financial pressure, threat, intimidation, or fear (coercion or force). Consent to engage in one sexual activity, or past agreement to engage in a particular sexual activity, cannot be presumed to constitute consent to engage in a different sexual activity or to engage again in a sexual activity. Consent cannot be validly given by a person who is incapacitated. 

At the heart of consent is the idea that every person has a right to personal sovereignty ÛÒ the right to not be acted upon by someone else in a sexual manner unless they give that person clear permission.  It is the responsibility of the person initiating the sexual activity to get this permission. 

Consent should not be assumed.

Respect other patrons personal space.",1

Andrew Ashong has released two EPs: ""Flowers"" with Theo Parrish (2012) and the ""Andrew Ashong EP"" (2014) which moved away from the dance floor sound of ""Flowers"" and interjected more soul and jazz inspired rhythms and textures ""A release less targeted to the dance floor, it instead chooses to retrospectively immerse in the ethics of true music"".

Folk/Americana/Country

Influenced by the sounds of Johnny Cash and Hank Williams, Joe Redding writes songs that are lyrically grounded in the darker aspects of the human experience. His fiery lyrics are brought to life by his raw, gritty baritone voice ÛÒ which at times ascends into higher registers ÛÒ revealing his passion for the heavy hitting, outlaw style of folk/country music that he came to love as a young man living in the Catskill Mountains.

Composed of 14 members, the band appeared first in the late 1990s. They soon became famous for their vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons they were avoided by most radio stations at first. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made their way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the prohibited words), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. Over the years popularity grew tremendously and after many TV and Film features, countless concerts and festival appearances all over the world, Leningrad is now one of the most renowned and legendary Russian bands attracting stadium-size crowds.""",1

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

As part of the 2016 edition of Crossing the Line, the French Institute Alliance FranÌ¤aise (FIAF)Ûªs celebrated contemporary arts festival, Times Square Arts is pleased to join FIAF, Dancing in the Strets, and their partners to present the US debut of breakdance world champion Anne Nguyen  in two distinct works: Graphic Cyphers, in Times Square and the South Bronx; and Autarcie (Û_.): a search for self-sufficiency at Gibney Dance in Manhattan.

Created in collaboration with 20 New York City street dancers, the world premiere of NguyenÛªs Graphic Cyphers is a radical take on the original hip-hop cypherÛÓthe circle of dancers that surrounds an ever-changing soloist. In this revitalization of traditional format, the audience will move between constellations of dancers in dizzying sequences of movement and ever-changing levels and locations. Graphic Cyphers will maintain the intimacy and dynamism of close audience proximity to the dancers, while keeping perspective, perception, and participation in constant flux.",0

The finale of the concert will be synchronized with a screening of Bischoff's video for ""Cistern,"" broadcast on numerous screens throughout Times Square.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

Chelsea and Clinton,2015-09-27T21:00:00-0400,"Join us for a special evening of stargazing to witness the rare Supermoon Total Eclipse while enjoying drinks and music on the High Line!

On Sunday, September 27, the Earth will pass between the Sun and the Moon and the Moon will move into the Earth's shadow completely for a period of about two and a half hours, beginning at 9 PM. Coincidentally, the Moon will be at its closest point to the Earth and thus appear 13% larger in area, which is why we call it a ""Supermoon.""

You won't need special equipment to see the eclipse, although our partners from the Amateur Astronomers Association will bring their telescopes and binoculars in case you want to see the event close up. They'll also be on hand to answer any questions you might have. 

Our partners from Terroir will set up a cash bar on the Sundeck, and our friends the F-Tones duo will delight us with acoustic music, creating an ideal night out with friends or a date.

Come join us for a Total Eclipse of the Heart (and Moon!) and get as nerdy or romantic as you wish.

ABOUT U.S. SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU
Mary L. Landrieu was first elected to the Louisiana state legislature at the age of 23. In 1996 she became the first woman from Louisiana elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Senator Landrieu has been the leading voice in Washington for the Gulf Coast recovery effort. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the failures of the federal levee system, she secured billions in recovery dollars and has worked extensively to jumpstart recovery projects. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Senator Landrieu introduced the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act, which will, for the first time, direct 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties paid by BP directly to the Gulf Coast.

ABOUT JEFF HEBERT
Jeff Hebert is the Executive Director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority where he is responsible for redevelopment projects for the City of New Orleans and the successful disposition of over 3,000 properties that were acquired through the stateÛªs housing recovery program.

Jeff found his way back home in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita serving as the Director of Community Planning for the Louisiana Recovery Authority where he was tasked with working with local governments throughout the state to develop recovery plans ÛÒ including the Unified New Orleans Plan.

Over the course of three Dutch Dialogue conferences, David has articulated a new vision of New Orleans as a delta city living with ÛÒ rather than against ÛÒ water to address long-term development of urban character and form.

David is currently leading a team of local and international experts to develop a Comprehensive Water Management Strategy for the Greater New Orleans region.

Tijdens het Amsterdam Art Weekend 2016 (24 - 27 nov) opent de tentoonstelling Jordan Wolfson: MANIC/LOVE in het Stedelijk, het eerste deel van het tweeluik van de Amerikaanse kunstenaar Jordan Wolfson. In beide delen van deze tentoonstelling staan spectaculaire 'animatronics' centraal: fascinerende maar ook angstaanjagende, door computers aangedreven mensfiguren, die zijn uitgerust met sensoren en daarom direct contact kunnen maken. In MANIC / LOVE wordt Wolfsons nieuwste animatronic Colored Sculpture (2016) gepresenteerd, een werk dat is gebaseerd op de geschiedenis van Amerikaanse popcultuur. Naast de animatronics zijn er videowerken en digitale schilderijen van Wolfson te zien.

Chelsea and Clinton,2016-11-15T19:00:00-0500,"The panel will examine Donald JuddÛªs relationship to the written word over the four decades contained in the new publication. The panel will include: Flavin Judd, Curator and Co-President of Judd Foundation, co-editor of Donald Judd Writings, and son of Donald Judd; Roberta Smith, Co-Chief Art Critic of The New York Times; Ann Temkin, Marie-JosÌ©e and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art. Moderated by Michael Govan, CEO and Wallis Annenberg Director of The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Donald Judd Writings, co-published by Judd Foundation and David Zwirner Books, is the most comprehensive collection of the artist's writings assembled to date. Available in November 2016, this timely publication includes JuddÛªs best-known essays, as well as little-known texts previously published in limited editions. Moreover, this new collection includes unpublished college essays and hundreds of never-before-seen notes, a critical but unknown part of JuddÛªs writing practice. 

JuddÛªs earliest published writing, consisting largely of reviews for hire, defined the terms of art criticism in the 1960s, but his essays as a graduate student at Columbia, published here for the first time, contain the seeds of his later writing, and allow readers to trace the development of his critical style. The writings that followed JuddÛªs early reviews are no less significant art-historically, but have been relegated to smaller publications and have remained largely unavailable until now. The largest addition of newly available material is a collection of JuddÛªs unpublished notesÛÓtranscribed from his handwritten accounts of and reactions to subjects ranging from the politics of his time to the literary texts he admired most. In these intimate reflections we see JuddÛªs thinking at his least mediatedÛÓa mind continuing to grapple with questions of its moment, thinking them through, changing positions, and demonstrating the intensity of thought that continues to make Judd such a formidable presence in contemporary art.",1

OSCAR MURILLO 
DIS PLACE 
YARAT Contemporary Art Centre, Baku, Azerbaijan 

YARAT Contemporary Art Space presents a major solo exhibition by Colombian-born artist Oscar Murillo. The exhibition, which includes a newly commissioned series of works in an immersive installation across media, continues the artistÛªs engagement with materials as a means of exploring wider conceptual dialogues surrounding structures of production within a specific geographic context. 

A core aspect of the show is the artistÛªs collaboration with a community of skilled workers in Sheki, a historic town in Northern Azerbaijan, which was an important post on the ancient Silk Route. Most of the elements in the exhibition were sourced from Sheki Silk Factory, which today operates at a fraction of its Soviet period scale, when it used to employ around 7000 workers. 

Murillo collaborated with local artisans to create a series of large-scale works based on a medieval stained glass technique still practiced in the region and found in ShekiÛªs famous KhanÛªs Palace. The artist replaces the delicate material of glass with scraps of discarded metal from the factory yard, thereby playing with the original aesthetic and adding a political dimension to the poetic oriental design. 

Murillo frequently explores issues of community and migration drawing upon his own cultural heritage and that of others. Through a meaningful collaboration with the Sheki silk factory and the townÛªs community, these discourses manifest themselves through both the materials he chooses to use and a revival of the factory as a site of production. 

This exhibition is curated by Suad Garayeva-Maleki

*Special thanks to Tunc LLC and Sheki Ipek JSC.

Exhibition opening day: 11 November 2016 at 7 pm  
Location: YARAT Contemporary Art Centre (National Flag Square, Bayil, AZ1003)
Dates: 11 November ÛÒ 29 January 2017 
Exhibition open: Tuesday through Sunday, from 11:00 until 20:00.

July 15th - ""The FIlms of Marcel Dzama"" Presented by Marcel Dzama

Marcel Dzama, the hugely popular artist fresh from his work on the New York City Ballet (The Most Incredible Thing), will present an extensive program of his films, including ÛÏSad Ghost,Û made with Spike Jonze, and ÛÏA JesterÛªs Dance,Û starring Kim Gordon with music by Arcade Fire. Mr. DzamaÛªs work is characterized by an immediately recognizable visual language that draws from a diverse range of references and artistic influences, including Dada and Marcel Duchamp. While he has become known for his prolific drawings with their distinctive palette of muted colors, in recent years, the artist has expanded his practice to encompass sculpture, painting, film, and dioramas.

Terra Firma restaurant, adjacent to the courtyard, will be serving their full food menu before, during and after the screenings, and drinks will be available from their bar.

The event is FREE and open to the public. We will have seating for 200 in the courtyard, first come first serve. There will be an alternate venue nearby in case of rain.

Composed of 14 members, the band appeared first in the late 1990s. They soon became famous for their vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons they were avoided by most radio stations at first. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made their way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the prohibited words), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. Over the years popularity grew tremendously and after many TV and Film features, countless concerts and festival appearances all over the world, Leningrad is now one of the most renowned and legendary Russian bands attracting stadium-size crowds.""",1

More about the artists-

----Laura Gibson----

ÛÏThe sound of a confident artist stretching her own limits, without losing sight of the warmth, richness, subtlety and haunted beauty that made her worth celebrating in the first place.Û NPR / National Public Radio 

""Rather than another exercise in genre-dabbling and dilettantism, La Grande succeeds as a cohesive work thanks to the persistence of Gibson's vision. As a songwriter she's preoccupied with those timeless questions of the human condition...Themes of love, loss, regret, and mortality crop up often, and, significantly, they're well-served by the surrounding songcraft.""  Pitchfork 

----Arms----

""In an indie-rock world saturated with bands struggling to differentiate themselves, ARMS prove that inventive songwriting and a catchy chorus will always set itself apart."" - The 405

""New York's most underrated band"" - I Guess I'm Floating


----Cassandra Jenkins----

A songwriter who knows how to ""leave an impression"" with ""elegantly celestial climaxes, emerald green-glowing guitar work"" (Pitchfork) and ""smoky"" vocals (NPR), Cassandra released self-titled EP, in 2013. Bedded in haunting arrangements of tremolo guitar and washy organ, she draws you into a world lying somewhere between Mazzy Star and Twin Peaks. It's an arrestingly intimate place, where if you listen closely enough, you'll find something as timeless as it is bittersweet. 

*******************************************************************

Made extra special thanks to the lovely people at MailChimp

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

Zoe Leonard's piece is presented as a 20 x 30 foot wheat-paste installation adjacent to the High Line at West 13th Street, and was originally written the year that poet Eileen Myles ran for president as an independent candidate alongside George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot. The text calls for a president who more accurately represents neglected and disenfranchised communities.

What would performance artists, poets, theater directors, and writers like to see their president be in 2016? Come discover it together, and join the conversation.

Part woman, part mannequin, Narcissister creates a video and performance spectacle that explores gender, racial identity, and sexuality. This performer, whose identity is a mystery, uses humor, pop songs, elaborate costumes, contemporary dance, and her trademark mask in order to deconstruct stereotypical representations.

Narcissister's rebellious and fun show is part of Out of Line, our summer-long tribute to the infamous Renegade Cabaret shows.

Narcissister is a Brooklyn-based artist and performer who works at the intersection of performance, dance, art, and activism. She has presented work in New York at The New Museum, MoMA, PS 1, The Kitchen, and at many alternative art spaces. She was nominated for a 2013 Bessie Award for ""Organ Player.""

ABOUT U.S. SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU
Mary L. Landrieu was first elected to the Louisiana state legislature at the age of 23. In 1996 she became the first woman from Louisiana elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Senator Landrieu has been the leading voice in Washington for the Gulf Coast recovery effort. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the failures of the federal levee system, she secured billions in recovery dollars and has worked extensively to jumpstart recovery projects. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Senator Landrieu introduced the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act, which will, for the first time, direct 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties paid by BP directly to the Gulf Coast.

ABOUT JEFF HEBERT
Jeff Hebert is the Executive Director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority where he is responsible for redevelopment projects for the City of New Orleans and the successful disposition of over 3,000 properties that were acquired through the stateÛªs housing recovery program.

Jeff found his way back home in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita serving as the Director of Community Planning for the Louisiana Recovery Authority where he was tasked with working with local governments throughout the state to develop recovery plans ÛÒ including the Unified New Orleans Plan.

Jeff has received a Bachelors in Urban Design & Architecture Studies from NYU and a Masters of City Planning from MIT.

Jeff is currently a board member of the Young Leadership Council, Second Harvest Food Bank, Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation and the United Way Vision Council.

ABOUT DAVID WAGGONNER
David Waggonner is the president of Waggonner & Ball Architects, an award-winning architecture and planning practice located in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is also the initiator of Dutch Dialogues, an exchange between Dutch engineering and design professionals and their American counterparts focused on water-based urban design. Over the course of three Dutch Dialogue conferences, David has articulated a new vision of New Orleans as a delta city living with ÛÒ rather than against ÛÒ water to address long-term development of urban character and form.

David is currently leading a team of local and international experts to develop a Comprehensive Water Management Strategy for the Greater New Orleans region. Ultimately the teamsÛª goal is to develop a model of sustainable delta urbanism that embraces water in all its forms to improve safety and resiliency, grow the economy and provide public amenities. The plan is scheduled for completion in late 2012.

As Senior Curator of Architecture and Design at MoMA The Museum of Modern Art, Paola Antonelli has worked to incorporate video games, biological waste and computer code into the canon of design.

The work of Lucy Beech and Edward Thomasson is characterised by choreographed group activities, often involving the live construction of sound. At the centre of their practice is an exploration of how performance is initiated in everyday environments and functions as a tool for working through experiences. 

Passive Aggressive 3 is the third in a trilogy of works in which small groups play movement-based games which attempt to negotiate negative interpersonal feelings. In this work, a group of women attempt to collectively manage their unspoken feelings of competition through physical movement, thus creating a soundscape of the unsaid. Passive Aggressive 3 thus continues Beech and ThomassonÛªs investigation into the therapeutic potential of double standards. 

Lucy Beech and Edward Thomasson have collaborated on performance projects since 2007. Recently they have presented Passive Aggressive 2 at Camden Arts Centre, London; Passive Aggressive at Yapi Kredi Culture Centre, Istanbul and Left Behind Together at Outpost Norwich. They have also presented projects and participated in exhibitions at Tate Britain, London; Biennale de Belleville, Paris; South London Gallery; Barbican Centre, London and Modern Art Oxford.",0

Carmen Herrera is one of the oldest working artists today. She was a pioneering abstract painter in the '40s and '50s, but only recently found the recognition that eluded her for most of her career. 

In The 100 Years Show, award winning director Alison Klayman (Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry) brings her camera into Carmen's home studio in New York City to uncover a story a century in the making.

Madison Square Park Conservancy today announced that Rachel FeinsteinÛªs Folly, three large-scale aluminum sculptures inspired by the artist-designed sets of the Ballets Russes, the improvisational spirit of the Commedia dellÛªArte, and decorative architecture commissioned by royals, will provide the backdrop for an evening of live performances, transforming Madison Square Park into a public theater on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. 

Marking the final days of FeinsteinÛªs Folly (open to the public through September 7, 2014), an exhibition of large scale sculptures that look like they could have come from a giant book of set designs but are, in fact, made of aluminum, will provide a fitting theatrical stage for a series of performances by contemporary artists, opera singers, musicians, puppets, dancers and more including:    

MY BARBARIAN

My Barbarian will present Broke Baroque Suite, an original operetta discussing topics of economics and art. The performers collaborate in chorus and solo numbers, including an aria by a soprano titled ÛÏI, Object,Û a baritone/tenor duet called ÛÏThe ArtisanÛªs Lament,Û and ÛÏThe Five Seasons,Û a dance-song. The audience will be involved in an improvisational incarnation of fortune- and future-telling.

ALLISON BRAINARD and CARA CHAN

Referencing Commedia dellÛªarte styles, Allison Brainard will choreograph a group of seven performers acting as harlequins. The performers will lead a raucous procession, travelling around the perimeter of the park and playfully moving park goers through the performance sites. They will enact simple improvised scores with each other, forming static tableaus and interacting with several instruments and sculptural elements created by Cara Chan. 

JARVIS COCKER

Inspired by Maurice RavelÛªs Daphnis et ChloÌ© for the Ballets Russes, Jarvis Cocker has created a musical interlude that will serve as a segue between the performances on the stage at FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House.

SOFIA COPPOLA

Film Director Sofia Coppola, in collaboration with Joffrey Ballet SchoolÛªs Director Jo Matos, and choreographer Irene Hogarth-Cimino and six young ballerinas will orchestrate a dance performance in response to the backdrop of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House. The ballerinas will dance to Isao TomitaÛªs re-orchestration of Claude DebussyÛªs ÛÏArabesqueÛ. 

TAMAR ETTUN AND THE MOVING COMPANY

Tamar Ettun will stage a performance piece incorporating five colorful, simultaneously occurring sculptural and sound events. Six ÛÏmoversÛ will attempt to accomplish durational physical tasks while negotiating FeinsteinÛªs outdoor sculptures, inflatable handmade balloons, and one another. Using a system of traditional rituals paired with postmodern dance concepts and gestures, the piece reflects on the human body in relation to deconstruction and stillness.

LITTLE DID PRODUCTIONS

As FeinsteinÛªs Folly brings European architecture from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Madison Square Park, Little Did Productions will bring fourth-century BCE India to Folly with verses from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Incorporating colorful overhead projections with found images from Indian shadow puppet theater, Little DidÛªs narrator and co-artistic director, Luke Santy, in collaboration with Jessica Lorence, will lend sitar and vocal accompaniment to images projected onto FeinsteinÛªs Rococo Hut.

LIL BUCK with PAUL CANTELON and WOLFRAM KOESSEL

Lil Buck is a Los Angeles-based street performer who specializes in jookinÛª. He will perform two improvised dances in front of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House, accompanied by Paul Cantelon on piano and Wolfram Koessel on cello.

KALUP LINZY with MIKE JACKSON

Romantic Loner One Life To Heal is a visual musical melodrama of torch songs performed live by Kalup Linzy as characters Kaye Braswell and Taiwan Braswell, KayeÛªs presumed-dead cousin. Both are members of the fictitious Queen Rose family, who feature in LinzyÛªs soap opera video series Conversations Wit De Churen, Melody Set Me Free, and As Da Art World Might Turns. The compositions are taken from LinzyÛªs musical visual projects Sweetberry Sonnet and Romantic Loner, released in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The performance will also include portions of 2013's Conversations Wit De Churen X: One Life To Heal and will include live musical accompaniment by Mike Jackson.

MOLLY LOWE

Sensuality meets the grotesque in Molly LoweÛªs performance beneath FeinsteinÛªs Flying Ship. Relating the sense of touch and impressions of space, performers will don one large costume made of many nude suits sewn together, forming an undulating blob.

ANGELA MCCLUSKEY and PAUL CANTELON

Singer/composer duo Angela McCluskey and Paul Cantelon will present a series of musical performances from their extensive archive. In addition, they will perform a new original score inspired by FeinsteinÛªs Folly.

SHANA MOULTON with NICK HALLETT and DAISY PRESS

Shana Moulton will activate Rachel Feinstein's Rococo Hut sculpture with a musical performance that includes interactive video projections, yoghurt, cat toys and massage tools. Composer Nick Hallett will sing original music with vocalist Daisy Press to accompany the performance.

TONY OURSLER and CONSTANCE DEJONG

Inspired by his childhood sailing along the Hudson River, along with his admiration of the Hudson River School of American painters, Tony Oursler, in collaboration with Constance DeJong, will present a new video projection of an animated fantasy on FeinsteinÛªs Flying Ship.

CARLOS VELA-PRADO

Within the context of the historical ÛÏfollyÛ premise, Carlos Vela-Prado will install inconspicuous sculptures and wireless speakers throughout Madison Square Park. They will emit soft-spoken voices, contributing to a soundscape that combines 1950s love songs, Fellini soundtracks, and traditional baroque strings with ambient and contemporary music. Vela-PradoÛªs audio selections will be restructured and mixed such as to confuse the individual parts while extending and incorporating each other into a textured ballad for FeinsteinÛªs sculptures and the eveningÛªs audience. 

Additionally, Feinstein has embarked on collaborations with some of todayÛªs most notable fashion designers, including Giles Deacon, Duro Olowu, Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez, Cynthia Rowley, Proenza Schouler, and Madeline Weinrib. Each designer will create a new Folly-inspired look, to be presented in unexpected ways alongside the festival performances as they unfold. 

Giles Deacon will create a new dress for Rachel Feinstein to wear throughout her Last Days of Folly performance festival. The dress will be inspired by Marie Antoinette and Folly, FeinsteinÛªs exhibition at Madison Square Park.

Duro Olowu will display a runway piece from his Spring 2008 collection. His model will travel throughout the park over the course of the evening.

Zac Posen will use the parkÛªs Oval Lawn as a performative runway. Posen will incorporate between ten and fifteen of his DavidÛªs Bridal wedding gowns into an animated showcase using both live models and puppeteers.

Narciso Rodriguez will create costumes for The Last Days of Folly performers Tamar Ettun and the Moving Company.

Cynthia Rowley will create a ÛÏfountain dressÛ for a model to wear in the reflecting pool at the north end of Madison Square Park. 

Inspired by Gelsomina, the ingÌ©nue of Federico FelliniÛªs La Strada, Proenza Schouler will create costumes for three clownish performers who will entertain park goers throughout the festival.

Madeline Weinrib will adorn the stage area in front of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House with a tableau of carpets inspired by a range of global cultures.


""Eavesdropping on peopleÛªs conversations in front of my sculptures and watching the public interact with them started my thoughts towards The Last Days of Folly. The interaction with people is what makes the sculptures pop. I became inspired to curate a performance festival using live theatre, colorful costumes, and different movements, forms and shapes to juxtapose the flatness, stillness, and whiteness of my sculptures,Û Feinstein explains. ÛÏBeing an artist is a solitary process, and through working with other artists I admire and who are successful in their different fields to make this festival happen I have learned so much.Û  
ÛÏRachel Feinstein has long wanted to activate, through public performances, her three sculptures in Madison Square Park,Û said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Martin Friedman Senior Curator at the Conservancy. ÛÏShe has organized an exciting and diverse group of artists, designers, musicians, puppeteers and dancers to program an evening akin to one of her primary inspirations, Commedia dellÛªarte.Û

The Last Days of Folly takes place at Madison Square Park, 23rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Rain or shine. 

About Folly:

Rachel FeinsteinÛªs Folly (on view in Madison Square Park through September 7, 2014), the artistÛªs first public art exhibition in the United States, consists of three monumental sculptures that evoke the architectural ÛÏfolliesÛ for which they are named ÛÒ structures built with decorative rather than functional purpose, most popular in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century landscape design. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff, a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a mast extending to the ground. FeinsteinÛªs sculptures reference theatrical sources like Ballets Russes backdrops and Commedia dellÛªarte stories, and their effect is that of a Fellini film set dropped into the middle of New York City. FeinsteinÛªs exhibition allows park goers to stumble into surprising cinematic worlds.",1

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,2011-03-31T11:00:00-0700,"Kota Ezawa is a German-born, San Fransisco-based video artist and illustrator who creates simple, graphic illustrations over film footage to produce short, witty narrative videos. 

City of Nature, EzawaÛªs original video commission for Mad. Sq. Art, weaves together excerpts from popular films, ranging from Fitzcarraldo to Twin Peaks in which nature is the only character featured onscreen.  These short clips are edited together to form what the artist calls a ÛÏvideo collageÛ or seamless montage, before being translated through freehand, computer assisted digital animation.  The resulting animated video stands as a visually striking and original work containing subtle, but deliberate echoes of iconic cultural moments embedded in our collective unconscious.  

In much the same way that Madison Square Park presents a cultivated and aestheticized side of nature, wildlife and green space amidst the urban landscape of central Manhattan, City of Nature examines the ways in which popular culture presents aestheticized images of the natural work, ÛÏunnaturalÛ visions of nature that embed themselves in our cultural memory and media landscape more deeply than we may consciously know.

Artist Kimsooja spent several days at the center and asked the residents about their lives, background, families and memories. She spent time getting to know them, gaining their trust and support and then filmed them over a period of two weeks. Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.

The program will include presentations, readings, practical exercises, and the Gurdjieff/de Hartmann music. There will be refreshments and opportunities for questions and conversation.

Despite the material and technological advances of modern society, more and more people feel a sense of emptiness in their life, a glimmer of recognition that they are moving through life in a kind of waking sleep.

This foundational course is open to certified yoga, pilates, fitness, and movement instructors. In this 40 Hour Training, you will learn a 90-minute Traditional Thai Bodywork sequence to include in your private practice, expand your understanding of energetic and physical healing, and enhance your knowledge of human movement, structural alignment and intuitive touch. Thai Yoga Bodywork is an ancient art form of energy-line (sen) stimulation, supported stretching, acupressure, deep-tissue release, and therapeutic touch that brings openness and relaxation to the body. Thai Yoga Bodywork is an integrative approach to health, combining breath, yoga asana and mindfulness meditation of Metta (loving compassion) into a flowing dance of continuous rhythmic motion. TYM works on the energy lines and points that correlate to physical, mental and emotional bodies to balance and harmonize all the systems in the body.

WhatÛªs Involved:
-Preparation of the body with warm-ups, breathing techniques and metta meditation
-Work within your own yoga practice and scope of movement to partner up and share a reciprocal dance of loving kindness, movement, and breath
-Introduction to the foundations of Thai Yoga (meditation in movement) and the principles of healing touch: correct postural alignment for giver, leverage and weight, connected breath, and delivering of intention through touch
-Learn a Thai Yoga sequence (approximately 1hr 30min).  This sequence is designed to restore basic flexibility, increase range of movement and balance the flow of energy.
In this Foundational Course, you will learn:
-How to work on the floor, practicing your yoga, and use leverage to deliver precise and connected bodywork
-How to use hands, feet, forearms to deliver mindful, healing touch
-The history of Buddhism and the oral tradition of Thai medicine
-How to feel and receive the message of the body, unblock energy, and create better flow
-When and how to stretch muscular/sen lines
-How to give a full body Thai Yoga session in the four traditional positions (prone, supine, side and sitting)

ÛÏTÛªai is an intuitive healer and an authentic teacher. I have learned so much just from watching her move in tandem with a clientÛÒ her ÛÏworkÛ is more like a beautiful dance.Û ~Katie OÛªConnell (Owner of Dragonfly Yoga Barn and Retreat Center)",1

Gramercy Park and Murray Hill,2016-07-15T18:30:00-0400,"Sn. Shivakripa,
a karma Sannyasi and Shikshaka of Atmadarshana yogashram, Bengaluru, India.

Pranayama is not just breathing practices, and prana is not just air that we breath. Breath is the external manifestation of prana, and prana is that subtle energy that can be enhanced with breath. Breathing exercises only oxygenate our bodies, whereas pranayama practices awaken the prana Shakti within us.

Pranayama is a science which is related to our breath and more so to the subtle flowing energies in this breath, which is known as prana. Prana exists within each one of us in a dormant form. When we practice pranayama, the quantity of this vital energy in the body is activated to a higher frequency, gearing us towards maintaining a healthy body and mind.

Diseases are the manifestation of an imbalance in the flow of prana within us. Pranayama reduces these blockages and replaces them with more and more prana, resulting in balance and harmony within and outside us.

At the physical level, these practices help in controlling and alleviating high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, rheumatism, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholesterol, fat, headaches, sinusitis, and various other ailments caused due to shallow breathing. At the spiritual level, these practices are said to be a direct link to our higher consciousness, the Paramatma.

All participants please make sure to wear natural fiber clothes, and ensure that your last meal is 3 hours prior to the workshop.

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

View the schedule of performances here: http://goo.gl/0yFZzL

More info about the all-star lineup at http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/the-last-days-of-folly

Madison Square Park Conservancy today announced that Rachel FeinsteinÛªs Folly, three large-scale aluminum sculptures inspired by the artist-designed sets of the Ballets Russes, the improvisational spirit of the Commedia dellÛªArte, and decorative architecture commissioned by royals, will provide the backdrop for an evening of live performances, transforming Madison Square Park into a public theater on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. 

Marking the final days of FeinsteinÛªs Folly (open to the public through September 7, 2014), an exhibition of large scale sculptures that look like they could have come from a giant book of set designs but are, in fact, made of aluminum, will provide a fitting theatrical stage for a series of performances by contemporary artists, opera singers, musicians, puppets, dancers and more including:    

MY BARBARIAN

My Barbarian will present Broke Baroque Suite, an original operetta discussing topics of economics and art. The performers collaborate in chorus and solo numbers, including an aria by a soprano titled ÛÏI, Object,Û a baritone/tenor duet called ÛÏThe ArtisanÛªs Lament,Û and ÛÏThe Five Seasons,Û a dance-song. The audience will be involved in an improvisational incarnation of fortune- and future-telling.

ALLISON BRAINARD and CARA CHAN

Referencing Commedia dellÛªarte styles, Allison Brainard will choreograph a group of seven performers acting as harlequins. The performers will lead a raucous procession, travelling around the perimeter of the park and playfully moving park goers through the performance sites. They will enact simple improvised scores with each other, forming static tableaus and interacting with several instruments and sculptural elements created by Cara Chan. 

JARVIS COCKER

Inspired by Maurice RavelÛªs Daphnis et ChloÌ© for the Ballets Russes, Jarvis Cocker has created a musical interlude that will serve as a segue between the performances on the stage at FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House.

SOFIA COPPOLA

Film Director Sofia Coppola, in collaboration with Joffrey Ballet SchoolÛªs Director Jo Matos, and choreographer Irene Hogarth-Cimino and six young ballerinas will orchestrate a dance performance in response to the backdrop of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House. The ballerinas will dance to Isao TomitaÛªs re-orchestration of Claude DebussyÛªs ÛÏArabesqueÛ. 

TAMAR ETTUN AND THE MOVING COMPANY

Tamar Ettun will stage a performance piece incorporating five colorful, simultaneously occurring sculptural and sound events. Six ÛÏmoversÛ will attempt to accomplish durational physical tasks while negotiating FeinsteinÛªs outdoor sculptures, inflatable handmade balloons, and one another. Using a system of traditional rituals paired with postmodern dance concepts and gestures, the piece reflects on the human body in relation to deconstruction and stillness.

LITTLE DID PRODUCTIONS

As FeinsteinÛªs Folly brings European architecture from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Madison Square Park, Little Did Productions will bring fourth-century BCE India to Folly with verses from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Incorporating colorful overhead projections with found images from Indian shadow puppet theater, Little DidÛªs narrator and co-artistic director, Luke Santy, in collaboration with Jessica Lorence, will lend sitar and vocal accompaniment to images projected onto FeinsteinÛªs Rococo Hut.

LIL BUCK with PAUL CANTELON and WOLFRAM KOESSEL

Lil Buck is a Los Angeles-based street performer who specializes in jookinÛª. He will perform two improvised dances in front of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House, accompanied by Paul Cantelon on piano and Wolfram Koessel on cello.

KALUP LINZY with MIKE JACKSON

Romantic Loner One Life To Heal is a visual musical melodrama of torch songs performed live by Kalup Linzy as characters Kaye Braswell and Taiwan Braswell, KayeÛªs presumed-dead cousin. Both are members of the fictitious Queen Rose family, who feature in LinzyÛªs soap opera video series Conversations Wit De Churen, Melody Set Me Free, and As Da Art World Might Turns. The compositions are taken from LinzyÛªs musical visual projects Sweetberry Sonnet and Romantic Loner, released in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The performance will also include portions of 2013's Conversations Wit De Churen X: One Life To Heal and will include live musical accompaniment by Mike Jackson.

MOLLY LOWE

Sensuality meets the grotesque in Molly LoweÛªs performance beneath FeinsteinÛªs Flying Ship. Relating the sense of touch and impressions of space, performers will don one large costume made of many nude suits sewn together, forming an undulating blob.

ANGELA MCCLUSKEY and PAUL CANTELON

Singer/composer duo Angela McCluskey and Paul Cantelon will present a series of musical performances from their extensive archive. In addition, they will perform a new original score inspired by FeinsteinÛªs Folly.

SHANA MOULTON with NICK HALLETT and DAISY PRESS

Shana Moulton will activate Rachel Feinstein's Rococo Hut sculpture with a musical performance that includes interactive video projections, yoghurt, cat toys and massage tools. Composer Nick Hallett will sing original music with vocalist Daisy Press to accompany the performance.

TONY OURSLER and CONSTANCE DEJONG

Inspired by his childhood sailing along the Hudson River, along with his admiration of the Hudson River School of American painters, Tony Oursler, in collaboration with Constance DeJong, will present a new video projection of an animated fantasy on FeinsteinÛªs Flying Ship.

CARLOS VELA-PRADO

Within the context of the historical ÛÏfollyÛ premise, Carlos Vela-Prado will install inconspicuous sculptures and wireless speakers throughout Madison Square Park. They will emit soft-spoken voices, contributing to a soundscape that combines 1950s love songs, Fellini soundtracks, and traditional baroque strings with ambient and contemporary music. Vela-PradoÛªs audio selections will be restructured and mixed such as to confuse the individual parts while extending and incorporating each other into a textured ballad for FeinsteinÛªs sculptures and the eveningÛªs audience. 

Additionally, Feinstein has embarked on collaborations with some of todayÛªs most notable fashion designers, including Giles Deacon, Duro Olowu, Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez, Cynthia Rowley, Proenza Schouler, and Madeline Weinrib. Each designer will create a new Folly-inspired look, to be presented in unexpected ways alongside the festival performances as they unfold. 

Giles Deacon will create a new dress for Rachel Feinstein to wear throughout her Last Days of Folly performance festival. The dress will be inspired by Marie Antoinette and Folly, FeinsteinÛªs exhibition at Madison Square Park.

Duro Olowu will display a runway piece from his Spring 2008 collection. His model will travel throughout the park over the course of the evening.

Zac Posen will use the parkÛªs Oval Lawn as a performative runway. Posen will incorporate between ten and fifteen of his DavidÛªs Bridal wedding gowns into an animated showcase using both live models and puppeteers.

Narciso Rodriguez will create costumes for The Last Days of Folly performers Tamar Ettun and the Moving Company.

Cynthia Rowley will create a ÛÏfountain dressÛ for a model to wear in the reflecting pool at the north end of Madison Square Park. 

Inspired by Gelsomina, the ingÌ©nue of Federico FelliniÛªs La Strada, Proenza Schouler will create costumes for three clownish performers who will entertain park goers throughout the festival.

Madeline Weinrib will adorn the stage area in front of FeinsteinÛªs Cliff House with a tableau of carpets inspired by a range of global cultures.


""Eavesdropping on peopleÛªs conversations in front of my sculptures and watching the public interact with them started my thoughts towards The Last Days of Folly. The interaction with people is what makes the sculptures pop. I became inspired to curate a performance festival using live theatre, colorful costumes, and different movements, forms and shapes to juxtapose the flatness, stillness, and whiteness of my sculptures,Û Feinstein explains. ÛÏBeing an artist is a solitary process, and through working with other artists I admire and who are successful in their different fields to make this festival happen I have learned so much.Û  
ÛÏRachel Feinstein has long wanted to activate, through public performances, her three sculptures in Madison Square Park,Û said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Martin Friedman Senior Curator at the Conservancy. ÛÏShe has organized an exciting and diverse group of artists, designers, musicians, puppeteers and dancers to program an evening akin to one of her primary inspirations, Commedia dellÛªarte.Û

The Last Days of Folly takes place at Madison Square Park, 23rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Rain or shine. 

About Folly:

Rachel FeinsteinÛªs Folly (on view in Madison Square Park through September 7, 2014), the artistÛªs first public art exhibition in the United States, consists of three monumental sculptures that evoke the architectural ÛÏfolliesÛ for which they are named ÛÒ structures built with decorative rather than functional purpose, most popular in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century landscape design. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff, a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a mast extending to the ground. FeinsteinÛªs sculptures reference theatrical sources like Ballets Russes backdrops and Commedia dellÛªarte stories, and their effect is that of a Fellini film set dropped into the middle of New York City. FeinsteinÛªs exhibition allows park goers to stumble into surprising cinematic worlds.",1

City of Nature, EzawaÛªs original video commission for Mad. Sq. Art, weaves together excerpts from popular films, ranging from Fitzcarraldo to Twin Peaks in which nature is the only character featured onscreen.  These short clips are edited together to form what the artist calls a ÛÏvideo collageÛ or seamless montage, before being translated through freehand, computer assisted digital animation.  The resulting animated video stands as a visually striking and original work containing subtle, but deliberate echoes of iconic cultural moments embedded in our collective unconscious.  

In much the same way that Madison Square Park presents a cultivated and aestheticized side of nature, wildlife and green space amidst the urban landscape of central Manhattan, City of Nature examines the ways in which popular culture presents aestheticized images of the natural work, ÛÏunnaturalÛ visions of nature that embed themselves in our cultural memory and media landscape more deeply than we may consciously know.

Artist Kimsooja spent several days at the center and asked the residents about their lives, background, families and memories. She spent time getting to know them, gaining their trust and support and then filmed them over a period of two weeks. Most people at the center are immigrants, coming from Latin and Central America, Europe and Asia; and they range in age from 60 to over 80. The resulting film is a delicate and profound investigation of human emotions, as each of the participants embarks on his/her won psychological journey, solitary at first and then as a group, which leads them from their past to the present and their future. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Kimsooja, Eleanor Heartney and Jane Farver. Presented by the Art History Department.

The program will include presentations, readings, practical exercises, and the Gurdjieff/de Hartmann music. There will be refreshments and opportunities for questions and conversation.

Despite the material and technological advances of modern society, more and more people feel a sense of emptiness in their life, a glimmer of recognition that they are moving through life in a kind of waking sleep. The Gurdjieff teaching, or ÛÏthe WorkÛ, through its principles and practices, enables serious seekers to find a new relationship between mind, body and feeling, and thus assists the development of consciousness and authentic conscience.

The Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, with affiliated centers in Europe and South America, was created after GurdjieffÛªs death for the practice of his teaching under the guidance of his devoted pupil Madame Jeanne de Salzmann.

a karma Sannyasi and Shikshaka of Atmadarshana yogashram, Bengaluru, India.

Pranayama is not just breathing practices, and prana is not just air that we breath. Breath is the external manifestation of prana, and prana is that subtle energy that can be enhanced with breath. Breathing exercises only oxygenate our bodies, whereas pranayama practices awaken the prana Shakti within us.

Pranayama is a science which is related to our breath and more so to the subtle flowing energies in this breath, which is known as prana. Prana exists within each one of us in a dormant form. When we practice pranayama, the quantity of this vital energy in the body is activated to a higher frequency, gearing us towards maintaining a healthy body and mind.

Diseases are the manifestation of an imbalance in the flow of prana within us. Pranayama reduces these blockages and replaces them with more and more prana, resulting in balance and harmony within and outside us.

At the physical level, these practices help in controlling and alleviating high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, rheumatism, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholesterol, fat, headaches, sinusitis, and various other ailments caused due to shallow breathing. At the spiritual level, these practices are said to be a direct link to our higher consciousness, the Paramatma.

All participants please make sure to wear natural fiber clothes, and ensure that your last meal is 3 hours prior to the workshop.

Reiki is a hands on healing system that is as powerful as it is simple.  Reiki is an empowering way to take care of yourself, enabling you to connect with your inner wisdom and find true health.

Reiki helps to reestablish balance on a physical, emotional and spiritual level, remove blockages, relieve stress and normalize body functions.

In this course, students will receive an attunement from the Reiki Master, allowing them access the Reiki energy.  Upon receiving the first attunement in reiki 1 the receiver becomes a channel for this universal healing energy.  The process of attunement is what sets reiki apart from every other form of touch healing.

Reiki 1 students will learn:

The science and the history of Reiki
Reiki self-treatment and a basic protocol to use with friends/family
Practical exercises
Guided-imagery meditations
Spiritual healing principles
Reiki history and precepts

YouÛªll have this healing practice for the rest of your life and it can become a significant source of inner support.

Frank Sinatra: A Swingin' Affair! will feature many of your favorite Sinatra classics, including ""Fly Me To The Moon"", ""The Summer Wind"", ""The Way You Look Tonight"", and ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" - as well as some rediscovered treasures from the vault, perhaps unheard since The Man himself first performed them.

The New York All-Star Big Band boasts what is truly a stellar assemblage of musicians, and this year they'll be joined by the nonpareil vocal group Gimme Four, who'll delight your ears as they harmonize alongside James in the distinctive Sinatra-Pied Pipers tradition.

The seminal quintet was formed in 1988 and went on to produce seven albums including a 25th anniversary, career-spanning box set released in 2013. From beginnings in NYC haunts like the Nightingale and the Wetlands, ÛÏGSWÛ became renowned as a national touring act throughout the 1990s, both as a headliner and alongside such artists as the Spin Doctors, the Dave Matthews Band, the Black Crowes and the Allman Brothers.
 
After breaking up in 2000 the band was brought back together ten years later to commemorate the passing of a close friend and long-time fan. Since 2010 GSW has had infrequent and memorable reunions, including performing as backing band for both Phil Lesh and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead.
 
The November 12 show brings a rare opportunity for fans old and new to experience an intimate one-of-a-kind God Street Wine concert in what's sure to be the bandÛªs only appearance for the rest of 2016.

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

Her masterful portraits, dragons and erotic sketches - sold under the name of her father - are coveted by upper crust Lords and journeyman print makers alike. In public, O-Ei knows and respects ""her place,"" but at home in the studio, she's as brash and uninhibited as her father, smoking a pipe while sketching erotic drawings that would make contemporary Japanese ladies blush. But despite her talent and fiercely independent spirit, O-Ei struggles under the domineering influence of her father and is ridiculed for lacking the life experience that she is attempting to portray in her art. MISS HOKUSAI's lively Edo (present day Tokyo) is filled with yokai spirits, dragons, and conniving tradesmen, while O-Ei's relationships with her famously impetuous father and blind younger sister provide a powerful emotional underpinning to this rollicking and sumptuously-animated feminist coming-of-age tale.

Her masterful portraits, dragons and erotic sketches - sold under the name of her father - are coveted by upper crust Lords and journeyman print makers alike. In public, O-Ei knows and respects ""her place,"" but at home in the studio, she's as brash and uninhibited as her father, smoking a pipe while sketching erotic drawings that would make contemporary Japanese ladies blush. But despite her talent and fiercely independent spirit, O-Ei struggles under the domineering influence of her father and is ridiculed for lacking the life experience that she is attempting to portray in her art. MISS HOKUSAI's lively Edo (present day Tokyo) is filled with yokai spirits, dragons, and conniving tradesmen, while O-Ei's relationships with her famously impetuous father and blind younger sister provide a powerful emotional underpinning to this rollicking and sumptuously-animated feminist coming-of-age tale.

DUMBO, Brooklyn

Curated by Erin Joyce Projects
Artists: Sama Alshaib, Basma Alsharif, Raven Chacon, Nicholas Galanin, Steven J. Yazzie

ÛÏThis Land is Your LandÛ is a six-film video installation that examines the dynamism of diasporic communities, the history of violence against diasporic individuals, and the profane abuse of assaultive power that manifests in governmental policies against immigrant or ÛÏunwantedÛ groups. The topic of this exhibition could not be more timely, with the Syrian Refugee Crisis at hand, and United State Government policy on Native American issues endangering the sovereignty of Native lands. The works in the show range from Nicholas GalaninÛªs examination of the devastating effects of petrol chemical companies invading Native lands, Steven J. YazzieÛªs work looking at the water crisis on Tribal land in Southern Arizona, Raven ChaconÛªs illustrative work on orchestrated violence and the instrumentalization of policy against people, Sama AlshaibÛªs works upon abusive power, and the destruction of environment and bio-location, and Basma AlsharifÛªs illustration of the end of nature. The exhibition, while offering aesthetic beauty, also enters into a pensive dialogue on pressing issues.

""Besides having a truly beautiful voice, young NYC songwriter Lynette Williams also possesses the ability to blend beautifully soul, pop and jazz influences. Her debut EP ÛÏSongs For SarahÛ is a surprising first effort, very mature musically and filled with quality tracks."" --Deli Magazine

Harlem-based artist Lynette Williams creates music that is complex and simple, dark and joyful, abstract and tangible ÛÓ sometimes all of that in the space of a single verse. It is at once tragic and joyful, quiet and mighty ÛÓ reserved and abandoned. Lynette sang backgrounds for Ms. Lauryn Hill and is also on Ms. HillÛªs track ÛÏConsumerismÛ. SheÛªs in the 2015 December issue of Essence and was a featured artist at The Apollo in February. Her own band plays around New York at local venues such as Rockwood, Bowery Electric, Lincoln Center, The Highline, The Blue Note, and Pianos. She currently has an EP out called ÛÏSongs for SarahÛ.

The Poofs are nondescript puppet objects which confound reason.  Inspiring wonder from their visitors the poofs simple ARE. They do not speak or react in any coherent manner. They are a cross between plants and insects, anchored to the ground and confounding an impression of rational sentience.

DUMBO, Brooklyn

Curated by Erin Joyce Projects
Artists: Sama Alshaib, Basma Alsharif, Raven Chacon, Nicholas Galanin, Steven J. Yazzie

ÛÏThis Land is Your LandÛ is a six-film video installation that examines the dynamism of diasporic communities, the history of violence against diasporic individuals, and the profane abuse of assaultive power that manifests in governmental policies against immigrant or ÛÏunwantedÛ groups. The topic of this exhibition could not be more timely, with the Syrian Refugee Crisis at hand, and United State Government policy on Native American issues endangering the sovereignty of Native lands. The works in the show range from Nicholas GalaninÛªs examination of the devastating effects of petrol chemical companies invading Native lands, Steven J. YazzieÛªs work looking at the water crisis on Tribal land in Southern Arizona, Raven ChaconÛªs illustrative work on orchestrated violence and the instrumentalization of policy against people, Sama AlshaibÛªs works upon abusive power, and the destruction of environment and bio-location, and Basma AlsharifÛªs illustration of the end of nature.

""Besides having a truly beautiful voice, young NYC songwriter Lynette Williams also possesses the ability to blend beautifully soul, pop and jazz influences. Her debut EP ÛÏSongs For SarahÛ is a surprising first effort, very mature musically and filled with quality tracks."" --Deli Magazine

Harlem-based artist Lynette Williams creates music that is complex and simple, dark and joyful, abstract and tangible ÛÓ sometimes all of that in the space of a single verse. It is at once tragic and joyful, quiet and mighty ÛÓ reserved and abandoned. Lynette sang backgrounds for Ms. Lauryn Hill and is also on Ms. HillÛªs track ÛÏConsumerismÛ. SheÛªs in the 2015 December issue of Essence and was a featured artist at The Apollo in February. Her own band plays around New York at local venues such as Rockwood, Bowery Electric, Lincoln Center, The Highline, The Blue Note, and Pianos. She currently has an EP out called ÛÏSongs for SarahÛ.

The Poofs are nondescript puppet objects which confound reason.  Inspiring wonder from their visitors the poofs simple ARE. They do not speak or react in any coherent manner. They are a cross between plants and insects, anchored to the ground and confounding an impression of rational sentience.

Peridance Contemporary Dance Company has been a powerhouse of energetic and evocative dance since its inception in 1983. The Company, known for Artistic Director Igal Perry's timelessly elegant and brilliantly musical choreography, has an illustrious performance history at venues including the Joyce Theater, the Rose Theater at Lincoln Center, and internationally in Italy, Israel, Korea and Bulgaria. Mr. Perry, together with Executive Director Yarden Ronen, have structured the Company to explore and experiment with innovative movement and design with an emphasis on performing repertory by notable choreographers as well as emerging talents.

The dancers are all classically trained - they hail from Japan, Korea, USA, Spain, and Columbia. PCDC is housed within Peridance Capezio Center in the Union Square area of New York City, with the beautiful Salvatore Capezio Theater as its resident performance venue.

The Company's annual NY Spring Season serves as a launch pad for 30+ annual performances, new works, and programs each year. PCDC constantly reaches out to its community by offering classes and outdoor showcases, and by donating performances to charitable organizations and schools. Residency work and commissions from major colleges and conservatories round out a full roster of creative and performing activities at the highest level of artistic excellence. 

PCDC has had the honor of performing in some of New York's most renowned theaters including the Joyce Theater, BAM and Kaye Playhouse. The Company has also toured nationally and internationally, performing in Japan, Korea and Italy. We invite you to visit the Company's website to learn more: https://www.peridance.com/pcdc/

DUMBO, Brooklyn

Curated by Erin Joyce Projects
Artists: Sama Alshaib, Basma Alsharif, Raven Chacon, Nicholas Galanin, Steven J. Yazzie

ÛÏThis Land is Your LandÛ is a six-film video installation that examines the dynamism of diasporic communities, the history of violence against diasporic individuals, and the profane abuse of assaultive power that manifests in governmental policies against immigrant or ÛÏunwantedÛ groups. The topic of this exhibition could not be more timely, with the Syrian Refugee Crisis at hand, and United State Government policy on Native American issues endangering the sovereignty of Native lands. The works in the show range from Nicholas GalaninÛªs examination of the devastating effects of petrol chemical companies invading Native lands, Steven J. YazzieÛªs work looking at the water crisis on Tribal land in Southern Arizona, Raven ChaconÛªs illustrative work on orchestrated violence and the instrumentalization of policy against people, Sama AlshaibÛªs works upon abusive power, and the destruction of environment and bio-location, and Basma AlsharifÛªs illustration of the end of nature. The exhibition, while offering aesthetic beauty, also enters into a pensive dialogue on pressing issues.

Harlem-based artist Lynette Williams creates music that is complex and simple, dark and joyful, abstract and tangible ÛÓ sometimes all of that in the space of a single verse.

Marymount Manhattan dance majors, the MMC community and friends present Twyla TharpÛªs THE ONE HUNDREDS on Sunday, May 1 in the Theresa Lang Theatre, 221 East 71st Street, New York City. Two performances are scheduled at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Free admission and no reservations necessary.

The MMC dance majors have been working with the Tharp choreographic material during the spring semester and they are now prepared to share their experience with other dancers, dance enthusiasts and individuals who love movement and movement invention. Veteran Tharp dancers Rose Marie Wright and Jennifer Way have been on campus contributing their expertise and assisting Associate Professor of Dance Anthony Ferro Ûª01, M.F.A., in mounting the work. Professor of Dance Katie Langan Ûª92 B.A., who also serves as chair of the MMC dance department and Ferro are former dancers with Twyla Tharp Dance.

Twyla TharpÛªs THE ONE HUNDREDS was first performed in 1970. In her words, the dance is ÛÏ...an exercise in aesthetic and physical deterioration. This dance is a series of 100 11-second movement phrases performed in three sections. In the first section, two skilled dancers, in unison, perform 100 movement phrases separated by four seconds of stillness (approximately 25 minutes); in the second section, five dancers perform 20 phrases each without pause (approximately five minutes); and in the third section, 100 people perform one phrase each (11 seconds). The movements are based on activities that anyone, including untrained dancers, could doÛÓsuch as skip, hop, shiver, and shakeÛÓand are performed in silence. As the time diminishes, so does the rigor and definition of the dancing. And at the climactic display of 100 soloists, the phrases become mere shadows of themselves.",0

Marymount Manhattan College Theatre Production Workshop presents a revival of Time and the Conways by J.B. Priestly from Wednesday, March 9 through Saturday, March 12 at 8 p.m. and on Sunday, March 13 at 2 p.m. in the Theresa Lang Theatre, located at 221 East 71st Street. 

Time and the Conways (1937) is a meditation on J. W. DunneÛªs theory of serial time, attesting that time is not merely a linear progression, but a concept that simultaneously contains past, present and future. The play follows the story of the seemingly perfect Conway familyÛÓAct One presents their perfect day, Act Two their worst day, and Act Three, the realization that their travails have paralleled the vanquished ideals of the British people between the wars. 

This production is performed by students in the Theatre Arts programs of the College with direction by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts Kevin Connell, scenic design by Sofia Palacios Blanca, costume design by Elise Vanderkley, lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, sound design by Meghan Rose Murphy, and dialect and text coaching by Professor of Theatre Arts Barbara Adrian. 

General admission tickets are $10. Tickets for senior citizens and students of others schools (with valid ID) are $5, and admission is free of charge for MMC students, alumni, faculty, and staff (with valid MMC ID). TDF vouchers are accepted.

Marymount Manhattan dance majors, the MMC community and friends present Twyla TharpÛªs THE ONE HUNDREDS on Sunday, May 1 in the Theresa Lang Theatre, 221 East 71st Street, New York City. Two performances are scheduled at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Free admission and no reservations necessary.

The MMC dance majors have been working with the Tharp choreographic material during the spring semester and they are now prepared to share their experience with other dancers, dance enthusiasts and individuals who love movement and movement invention. Veteran Tharp dancers Rose Marie Wright and Jennifer Way have been on campus contributing their expertise and assisting Associate Professor of Dance Anthony Ferro Ûª01, M.F.A., in mounting the work. Professor of Dance Katie Langan Ûª92 B.A., who also serves as chair of the MMC dance department and Ferro are former dancers with Twyla Tharp Dance.

Twyla TharpÛªs THE ONE HUNDREDS was first performed in 1970. In her words, the dance is ÛÏ...an exercise in aesthetic and physical deterioration. This dance is a series of 100 11-second movement phrases performed in three sections. In the first section, two skilled dancers, in unison, perform 100 movement phrases separated by four seconds of stillness (approximately 25 minutes); in the second section, five dancers perform 20 phrases each without pause (approximately five minutes); and in the third section, 100 people perform one phrase each (11 seconds). The movements are based on activities that anyone, including untrained dancers, could doÛÓsuch as skip, hop, shiver, and shakeÛÓand are performed in silence. As the time diminishes, so does the rigor and definition of the dancing. And at the climactic display of 100 soloists, the phrases become mere shadows of themselves.",0

Marymount Manhattan College Theatre Production Workshop presents a revival of Time and the Conways by J.B. Priestly from Wednesday, March 9 through Saturday, March 12 at 8 p.m. and on Sunday, March 13 at 2 p.m. in the Theresa Lang Theatre, located at 221 East 71st Street. 

Time and the Conways (1937) is a meditation on J. W. DunneÛªs theory of serial time, attesting that time is not merely a linear progression, but a concept that simultaneously contains past, present and future. The play follows the story of the seemingly perfect Conway familyÛÓAct One presents their perfect day, Act Two their worst day, and Act Three, the realization that their travails have paralleled the vanquished ideals of the British people between the wars. 

This production is performed by students in the Theatre Arts programs of the College with direction by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts Kevin Connell, scenic design by Sofia Palacios Blanca, costume design by Elise Vanderkley, lighting design by Matthew McCarthy, sound design by Meghan Rose Murphy, and dialect and text coaching by Professor of Theatre Arts Barbara Adrian. 

General admission tickets are $10. Tickets for senior citizens and students of others schools (with valid ID) are $5, and admission is free of charge for MMC students, alumni, faculty, and staff (with valid MMC ID). TDF vouchers are accepted.

Voices from The Long War at Lincoln Center is a joint production of The Telling Project and Tom Berry, supported by The Jackson Institute of Public Affairs at Yale University, the Yale School of Drama and Adept Word Management, and presented by the Lincoln Center Veterans Initiative.

Yet in spite of her talent and her familyÛªs prominence (friends of Vermeer and possibly Rubens, prominent merchants and art collectors), she received no commissions from church or court due to an insurmountable double whammy: she was both a Jew and a woman. 

Enter Sonnambula, the ensemble that was hailed by The New Yorker as ""superb."" In this holiday program, Sonnambula re-creates a festive evening at the Duarte household with music by Leonora as well as friends and fellow musicians.

Jerusalem is often described as a city of three faiths, but that vastly underestimates its multilayered complexity. History records harmonious and dissonant voices of people from many lands, passing in the narrow streets of a city not much larger than Midtown Manhattan. In this world premiere, MetLiveArts has commissioned the celebrated young composer Mohammed Fairouz to translate those many voicesÛÓboth harmonious and dissonantÛÓinto music. Working closely with Met curators, Fairouz has created an oratorio that's equal parts musical theater, magical realism, and spiritual journey. The Grammy nominated Metropolis Ensemble performs.

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

====Featuring DJ Sets From===
////// Murlo
///// Dre Skull
//// The Large
// Wildlife! 
/ Special guest Bobby Konders of Massive B Soundsystem/Hot 97

Mixpak
Mixpak is a Brooklyn-based record label, founded in 2009 by producer Dre Skull. Home to some of JamaicaÛªs biggest stars, Mixpak has released full length albums with Vybz Kartel and Popcaan as well as riddim releases featuring Beenie Man, Machel Montano, Tifa, Spice and more. 

Bobby Konders 
DJ and producer Bobby Konders started his own record label Massive B over 20 years ago. After producing the reggae/hip-hop smash ÛÏMack DaddyÛ with Salaam Remi and a now classic remix for SupercatÛªs ÛÏGhetto Red Hot,Û Massive B became a go-to for dancehall and reggae acts in New York and beyond. While the label released records by Burro Banton, Nicodemus, King Kong, Junior Reid, Sizzla, Richie Spice, and more, the crew took up their now longstanding Sunday-night slot on Hot 97, as well as presenting New YorkÛªs yearly ÛÏOn Da Reggae Tip,Û a much-loved float at the West Indian Day Parade, and the weekly dancehall party ÛÏFire SundaysÛ in Queens.
				
Murlo
Influenced as much by the sonic narratives of film scores as by U.K. dance music, DJ and producer Murlo works together the discombobulated sounds and mutations of the current clubland with the Afro-Caribbean rhythms that historically underpin LondonÛªs dance culture.

Dre Skull 
Dre Skull became a producer and label owner of Mixpak after collaborating with Jamaican superstar Vybz Kartel on the full-length ÛÏKingston StoryÛ for Mixpak. Since then, he has worked with Popcaan, Pusha T, Beenie Man, Jamie XX, How to Dress Well, Snoop Lion, and more, following the legendary paths of Don Was and Rick Rubin in the school of any-genre-goes. 

The Large
The Large was raised in Bristol, U.K., surrounded by the vibes of Massive Attack, Tricky, and St PaulÛªs Carnival. Starting out as resident at the HeatwaveÛªs legendary ÛÏHot WukÛ party in London, she now lives in NYC where she acts as the official spirit guide for Mixpak. 

Wildlife! 
After years of touring his own soundsystem and studying audio engineering, Wildlife! turned his hand to production, making left-field riddims with Jamaican artist Terry Lynn, straight-up club productions, and releasing two full albums under his experimental electronic-music moniker, Young Palace. In 2015, he finished up his Master of Arts degree in contemporary-arts practice, and has since had sound-installation work featured in gallery exhibitions worldwide.

""One of the most talented composers of his generation."" ÛÓBBC News

Jerusalem is often described as a city of three faiths, but that vastly underestimates its multilayered complexity. History records harmonious and dissonant voices of people from many lands, passing in the narrow streets of a city not much larger than Midtown Manhattan. In this world premiere, MetLiveArts has commissioned the celebrated young composer Mohammed Fairouz to translate those many voicesÛÓboth harmonious and dissonantÛÓinto music. Working closely with Met curators, Fairouz has created an oratorio that's equal parts musical theater, magical realism, and spiritual journey. The Grammy nominated Metropolis Ensemble performs.

Renown did not lead to riches, and following a 1968 coup, Boubacar dropped out of sight. Personal tragedy led him to move to France, where eventually, he was rediscovered.

Join us for the second Û÷Artists at the CrossroadsÛª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.

During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.

In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New YorkersÛª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ÛÏnever go there,Û by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.

For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.

Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times SquareÛªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this. Join us to hear and see a bit of what happened.

Show: 8PM
Screaming Females has collaborated with video artist Faye Orlove for a mischievous animation, signature to Orlove's style, while specially crafted to match the band's powerful sound. Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.

Bios
Screaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the bandÛªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti SmithÛªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.

Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.

Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.

Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism. In 2015, she published her first book, Shrine, through Don Giovanni Records. She is the creator, director, and producer of animated music videos for artists like Mitski, Potty Mouth, and Downtown Boys.",1

In a special webcast, Nobel Laureate Dr. Eric R. Kandel, and Drs. Elias Pavlopoulos and Scott A. Small discuss their new study, the science of age-related memory loss, and the prospects for helping people recover their ability to remember.

Recently, researchers with the Kavli Institute for Brain Science (KIBS) at Columbia University found compelling evidence that age-related memory loss is a syndrome in its own right, apart from AlzheimerÛªs. In fact, in the case of one type of age-related memory loss  -- again, distinct from Alzheimer's -- researchers were able to restore memory function in mice so that it was comparable to that of young mice. These are exciting findings that, along with implications for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of memory disorders, may in the future have significant public health consequences.

North Queens,2016-12-16T19:00:00-0500,"Gamelan Son of Lion is a repertory ensemble that bridges two musical worlds: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia. The instruments are from Indonesia with home-made additions. The music is written by the group of composer-performers, each in their unique styles, as well as traditional music of Bali and Java.

Gamelan Son of Lion ÛÒ which is based on New York City - bridges two musical words: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia, employing instruments from Indonesia with homemade additions. There are about 100 active gamelan ensembles in the United States, and Gamelan Son of Lion rates among the oldest of these, having performed continuously for 40 years. It is also one of the few in this country that operate independently of institutions as a professional music ensemble.
The New York Times described the ensemble as ÛÏthe most prominent New York-area manifestation of a fascinating nationwide movement.Û The ensemble ÛÒ which was co-founded by a trip of composers, Barbara Benary, Daniel Goode, and Philip Corner in the 1970s, and became incorporated in 1980 ÛÒ has routinely performed experimental works by Indonesian composers, many involving gamelan with electronic music, and several theatre works involving opera, wayang kulit, multimedia and dance.

At Flushing Town HallÛªs event, performers will include: Barbara Benary (Artistic Director) , David Demnitz, Daniel Goode, Nicholas Klinovsky, Jody Kruskal, Skip LaPlante,  Laura Liben, Layne Negrin, Myles Robert, Larry Simon and Sima Wolf.

ÛÏOur ensemble, unlike orchestras, is a democratic affair in which most of the musicians can play most of the instruments, and do switch parts frequently with different compositions,Û says Co-founder Barbara Benary. ÛÏSo no one is the soloist and many people are.Û

The instruments are from Indonesia with home-made additions. The music is written by the group of composer-performers, each in their unique styles, as well as traditional music of Bali and Java.

Gamelan Son of Lion ÛÒ which is based on New York City - bridges two musical words: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia, employing instruments from Indonesia with homemade additions. There are about 100 active gamelan ensembles in the United States, and Gamelan Son of Lion rates among the oldest of these, having performed continuously for 40 years. It is also one of the few in this country that operate independently of institutions as a professional music ensemble.
The New York Times described the ensemble as ÛÏthe most prominent New York-area manifestation of a fascinating nationwide movement.Û The ensemble ÛÒ which was co-founded by a trip of composers, Barbara Benary, Daniel Goode, and Philip Corner in the 1970s, and became incorporated in 1980 ÛÒ has routinely performed experimental works by Indonesian composers, many involving gamelan with electronic music, and several theatre works involving opera, wayang kulit, multimedia and dance.

At Flushing Town HallÛªs event, performers will include: Barbara Benary (Artistic Director) , David Demnitz, Daniel Goode, Nicholas Klinovsky, Jody Kruskal, Skip LaPlante,  Laura Liben, Layne Negrin, Myles Robert, Larry Simon and Sima Wolf.

ÛÏOur ensemble, unlike orchestras, is a democratic affair in which most of the musicians can play most of the instruments, and do switch parts frequently with different compositions,Û says Co-founder Barbara Benary. ÛÏSo no one is the soloist and many people are.Û

At a young age Ka'b ibn Malik had it all; married, wealthy, he was a companion of the messenger of Allah and of the very first in Medinah to believe in him and serve him. His faith was unwavering, his reputation was impeccable.

And then...he made a mistake.  

A mistake so big that it turned his world upside down and made the entire city of believers shun him. 

His mistake could have broken him.  It could have destroyed him. But it didn't.  
 
The repentance of Ka'b ibn Malik is one of the most unique stories of the seerah.  Told entirely in the first person of the person who lived it, it is a tale of loss, seclusion, trials, temptation..

And redemption. 

Some of the story highlights will include:

1)   The consequences of sins in their immediate and long term effects

2)   The role friendship plays in our success or failure

3)   The conditions of a sincere repentance

4)   The virtues of truthfulness

5)   The recognizing of blessings and how to increase them",0

Central Queens,2014-06-07T11:00:00-0400,"Sensei Erik PaulsonÛªs martial arts journey began in 1974, in Judo. From there, he went on to train in the disciplines of Freestyle and Greco-Roman Wrestling, Boxing, Jeet Kune Do, Filipino Martial Arts (Kali/Eskrima/Arnis), Shoot Wrestling, and Brazilian JiuJitsu. Erik is world renown for his grappling, and is considered a leading authority in MMA.

Erik is the founder of CSW (Combat Submission Wrestling) and STX Kickboxing (Savate-Thai Crosstraining). Besides Heading CSW Training Center in Fullerton Ca., Erik has also written a book ÛÏHistory of American Submission Wrestling, and was a coach of Team Lesnar on The Ultimate Fighter, Season 13.

Saturday June 7th - STX KICKBOXING -
This hybrid striking system developed by Erik Paulson focuses on explosive techniques in Boxing, Panatukan, Jun Fan/JKD Kickboxing, Savate, and Muay Thai (Thai & Dutch methods).  In STX Kickboxing, students will learn a blend of elbows, punches and knees from each art. These skills are easily translated in MMA, kickboxing, and self-defense situations.  From glove drills, focus mitts, Thai-pads, and sparring, students will have a variety of striking options.

Sunday June 8th - Combat Submission Wrestling -
ErikÛªs system (CSW) blends Judo, Freestyle Wrestling, and Greco-Roman Wrestling with techniques and submissions from Shootwrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Catch Wrestling. CSW trains the individual to strike, clinch, takedown, and submit on the ground in either a sport, mixed martial art, or self-defense environment. It is laden with painful submission hold and a plethora of devastating leg locks. The evolved style provides the perfect compliment to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.",1

Ajarn Chai came to the United States with a vision to spread Muay Thai throughout the world, and he is the first-ever Thai boxing instructor to teach Americans this art. He has worked tirelessly for 40 years to that end. We are indeed grateful to Ajarn Chai for his gift of the knowledge of Muay Thai.

The TBA-USA now has representation in almost every state in the USA and has expanded to establish affiliate organizations in more than 15 countries around the world.

Ajarn Surachai Sirisute recently went into semi-retirement, consequently limiting his seminar engagements to only 4 or 5 per year in the United States. He has chosen to do this upcoming seminar in New York and we are honored to have him. Please take this rare opportunity to train with the man that helped bring Thai boxing to the United States and take it to the phenomenon that it is now.

Black Radical Imagination is a touring program of visual shorts that delve into the worlds of new media, video art, and experimental narrative, growing out of a series of discussions about the boundaries and limitations that people of color have historically faced in the realm of the cinematic. Focusing on new stories within the Diaspora, each artist contributes their own vision of postmodern society through the state of contemporary black culture.

The museum will be free and open to the public, and a special VW Sunday Sessions performance and discussion will take place in the afternoon.

Also opening: 'Projects 105: Cinthia Marcelle' and 'Sascha Braunig: Shivers.' 

For the opening of 'Mark Leckey: Containers and Their Drivers,' Leckey activates his Sound Systems (2001-12), a series of massive anthropomorphic speaker towers, in front of a live audience. In 2003, LeckeyÛªs first Sound System performance, 'BigBoxStatueAction' at Tate Britain, featured one of his speaker towers with Jacob EpsteinÛªs classic modernist sculpture, Jacob and the Angel (1940-41), blasting songs ranging from the Beach BoysÛª ÛÏOur PrayerÛ to Throbbing GristleÛªs ÛÏPersuasion.Û  In doing so Leckey contrasted EpsteinÛªs massive alabaster sculpture, inherently static, silent and invariable with the fleeting, continuously changing and invisible material that is sound. Far from a critique of sculpture, Leckey considers this acoustic set-up a different form of art appreciation: one that is intuitive and communal.

Following the performance, Leckey will speak with two of the exhibitionÛªs curators, Peter Eleey, Curator and Associate Director of Exhibitions and Programs, MoMA PS1, and Stuart Comer, Chief Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art.",1

Black Radical Imagination is a touring program of visual shorts that delve into the worlds of new media, video art, and experimental narrative, growing out of a series of discussions about the boundaries and limitations that people of color have historically faced in the realm of the cinematic. Focusing on new stories within the Diaspora, each artist contributes their own vision of postmodern society through the state of contemporary black culture. An artistic movement as well as a school of thought, Black Radical Imagination uses cinema to explore the aesthetics of afrofuturism, afrosurrealism, and the magnificent.

The museum will be free and open to the public, and a special VW Sunday Sessions performance and discussion will take place in the afternoon. 

3PM, Kunsthalle ÛÒ Mark Leckey,  'BigBoxPS1Action'

4PM, the VW Dome ÛÒ Conversation with Mark Leckey, Peter Eleey and Stuart Comer

Also opening: 'Projects 105: Cinthia Marcelle' and 'Sascha Braunig: Shivers.' 

For the opening of 'Mark Leckey: Containers and Their Drivers,' Leckey activates his Sound Systems (2001-12), a series of massive anthropomorphic speaker towers, in front of a live audience. In 2003, LeckeyÛªs first Sound System performance, 'BigBoxStatueAction' at Tate Britain, featured one of his speaker towers with Jacob EpsteinÛªs classic modernist sculpture, Jacob and the Angel (1940-41), blasting songs ranging from the Beach BoysÛª ÛÏOur PrayerÛ to Throbbing GristleÛªs ÛÏPersuasion.Û  In doing so Leckey contrasted EpsteinÛªs massive alabaster sculpture, inherently static, silent and invariable with the fleeting, continuously changing and invisible material that is sound. Far from a critique of sculpture, Leckey considers this acoustic set-up a different form of art appreciation: one that is intuitive and communal.

Following the performance, Leckey will speak with two of the exhibitionÛªs curators, Peter Eleey, Curator and Associate Director of Exhibitions and Programs, MoMA PS1, and Stuart Comer, Chief Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art.",1

Southwest Queens,2014-02-23T10:00:00-0500,"At 18 weeks pregnant I was told they couldn't see the 4 chambers in valentina's heart. The Dr's sent me for a 2 hour fetal echo where they look at every part of her heart...It was recommended I abort. We then flew to Boston where they told us she only had a 75% chance of living until she was 3. Then we went to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they explained exactly what Valentina had and the 3 heart surgeries she would be getting to ""fix"" her heart.  The first at 3 days old the 2nd at 6 months old and her 3rd at 2-3 years old.

She was born in Philadelphia on February 15th with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome which is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is underdeveloped so her right ventricle is doing the work for both. She also has Heterotaxy, which is where her heart and some of her organs are reversed, and Asplenia, which means she has no spleen.

On February 18th she had her 1st surgery which went amazing.  We were home 8 days later. Her second surgery was scheduled for August 28 but on July 10 her oxygen level dropped and she was transported to Philadelphia to have surgery that week. The surgery went well but her recovery wasn't great. She got sick and ended up coming home a month later. Because of her heterotaxy her intestines were mal rotated,  so in November she had surgery to correct them.

We were lucky enough to be able to be with our daughter through her surgeries and stay in a hotel close to the hospital. Being there we met many families that weren't able to afford to stay near the hospital and families that couldn't take off work to be with their babies all day. A portion of the money that we are donating to the hospital is going to the cardiac social work department so they can help the families be able to make it work so they can be with their babies.  
Another portion is going to the cardiac child life program which is so special. Some of these cardiac babies are there for months at a time, like one of valentina's  roommates who was there from the day he was born until his 1st birthday where he received his heart transplant. So the cardiac child life tries to make these children's stays a little bit more enjoyable with games, arts and crafts and music class.

And the last portion is going to cardiac research because hopefully Valentina will get to grow up get married have babies and live a long fulfilling life which if she was born 30 years ago, she probably wouldn't have been able to.

$50 donations to take part in our fundraiser!

The first at 3 days old the 2nd at 6 months old and her 3rd at 2-3 years old.

She was born in Philadelphia on February 15th with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome which is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is underdeveloped so her right ventricle is doing the work for both. She also has Heterotaxy, which is where her heart and some of her organs are reversed, and Asplenia, which means she has no spleen.

On February 18th she had her 1st surgery which went amazing.  We were home 8 days later. Her second surgery was scheduled for August 28 but on July 10 her oxygen level dropped and she was transported to Philadelphia to have surgery that week. The surgery went well but her recovery wasn't great. She got sick and ended up coming home a month later. Because of her heterotaxy her intestines were mal rotated,  so in November she had surgery to correct them.

We were lucky enough to be able to be with our daughter through her surgeries and stay in a hotel close to the hospital. Being there we met many families that weren't able to afford to stay near the hospital and families that couldn't take off work to be with their babies all day. A portion of the money that we are donating to the hospital is going to the cardiac social work department so they can help the families be able to make it work so they can be with their babies.  
Another portion is going to the cardiac child life program which is so special. Some of these cardiac babies are there for months at a time, like one of valentina's  roommates who was there from the day he was born until his 1st birthday where he received his heart transplant. So the cardiac child life tries to make these children's stays a little bit more enjoyable with games, arts and crafts and music class.

And the last portion is going to cardiac research because hopefully Valentina will get to grow up get married have babies and live a long fulfilling life which if she was born 30 years ago, she probably wouldn't have been able to.

$50 donations to take part in our fundraiser!

Mierle Laderman Ukeles and the Museum have conceived a series of public programs meant to engage and contemporize some of Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance ArtÛªs important themes.

At 2,200+ acres, the Fresh Kills Landfill, which operated from 1948-2001, would span the equivalent of lower Manhattan to 34th Street and is nearly 3x the area of Central Park.  Participants will learn about the history of the site and gain the perspectives of the Sanitation and Parks Departments on the transformation of the landscape during those years, what is involved in re-purposing a former solid waste disposal facility of this scale into publicly accessible recreational space; current activities and visions for the future.

The first stop will be the site of Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª Percent for Art project for the future Freshkills South Park entitled Landing. Upon completion it will have  three components: the soaring, cantilevered Overlook and the two earthworks, Earth Bench and Earth Triangle. These three components will be connected by the newly graded and ADA-accessible landbridge whichÛÒ at nearly 500 feet long and some 32 feet above the tidal inlet belowÛÒconnects the two mounds that form South Park (a combined 147 acres).  This will be followed by visits to adjacent viewing areas to get different perspectives of the Landing site and appreciate the larger context of UkelesÛªs experiential art: framed by the cityÛªs Û÷landfill to landscapeÛ master plan, the site reveals the contradictions and unity of ÛÏman-made natureÛ and ÛÏman-made urbanism.""

Meeting Point: Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Staten Island side; Ramp E/ Taxi stand. You should be able to take the 11am ferry and join us at the bus by 11:30am.

Logistics: There will be a rest room stop. However, participants should bring their own nourishment (there will be no stops for food), dress warmly and wear sturdy shoes or boots. All visitors are required to sign waivers before entering the site.

To accompany the current exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents a special convening that explores the NYC Department of SanitationÛªs ambitious 0x30 initiative to radically rework the CityÛªs garbage and recycling infrastructure. The convening features the perspective of voices that are rarely heard from but are critical to the success of this initiative: residential building supers.

There will be brief presentations by Larissa Harris of the Queens Museum, NYC Department of SanitationÛªs (DSNY) Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, Anthropologist in Residence Robin Nagle, and Artist in Residence, Mierle Laderman-Ukeles explaining the critical role maintenance work plays in achieving 0x30.

Additionally, we will witness a conversation between residential building maintenance staff to see how managing waste will maximize diversion in the cityÛªs residential buildings.

DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, ÛÏWhile many people view us, while the sanitation workers are out doing their job, they donÛªt actually see us. This is also true for the maintenance workers handling waste within the cityÛªs buildings before it gets to the curb. This conversation is an opportunity to bring to light a behind the scenes maintenance perspective for New Yorkers. It is an honor to be able to work with the Queens Museum on such an innovative exchange of ideas.Û

The special discussion will take place around Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for UkelesÛªs installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it is suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.

A screening of new video works by Joianne Bittle, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Dylan Gauthier, Nathan Kensinger, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, and Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)

Over the past two summers, the artists of Chance Ecologies have engaged with three different sites in Queens: HunterÛªs Point South, the Newtown Creek and the Flushing River. The works in this screening present a wide range of responses to these post-industrial sites, ranging from collaborative performances to solitary explorations, and employ a variety of film techniques, including stop motion animation, underwater recordings, and drone footage. Each of these films is a unique creation inspired by a different aspect of these landscapes, and when viewed together, they present a larger picture of the ideas informing Chance Ecologies.

2ÛÓ3:30pm: Creatively Engaging Chance Ecologies
Artist talks by Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright

Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a variety of creative approaches to engaging with flora and fauna found in post-industrial urban wildernesses. These artist talks will take a deeper look into three different approaches to the landscape, from walking to seed collecting to virtual reality.

Coyote Walk Project
Dillon de Give will speak about the Coyote Walk Itinerancy, a short walking residency which he has been leading annually for 8 years. Originally inspired by Hal, a wild coyote that appeared in New York City in 2006, the project examines and traces greenspace channels running through NYC and surrounding wilds. This talk will begin in the Community Partnerships Gallery, move to the Panorama of New York City, and end in the Queens Museum theater.

Vegetative Resistance: Weeds and Wildness in Human Dominated Landscapes
Ellie Irons works with cosmopolitan spontaneous plants that thrive in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. Often described as weeds, they provide a starting point for exploring nativeness, invasion, gentrification and the future of land use in the face of global climate change. As we concern ourselves with big questions of globalization, mass extinction, and climate change, we exert control in small ways by attempting to restore or cultivate landscape fragments to mimic historical ideals. As we pour resources into such measures, what are we losing, erasing, eradicating? Expanding from these questions, Irons will explore the tale of one particular weedy species: Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis), while raising questions about human and vegetative agency in the so-called Anthropocene.

Hidden Vistas: Empathy and Place in Virtual Reality Installations
What does it mean to have empathy for a place? How can we use cutting edge technologies such as virtual reality and 360å¡ video to immerse a viewer in places that no longer exist? That are too difficult to find? Too hazardous to visit? Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright share their creative process of applying ÛÏthe empathy machineÛ to wild geographies.

3:30ÛÓ4:30pm: Digging into Chance Ecologies
A public discussion led by the curators of Chance Ecologies and Daniel Campo

The closing event of this daylong symposium will open up a larger conversation amongst the artists and participants of Chance Ecologies, lead by co-curators Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger and by Daniel Campo, author of ÛÏThe Accidental Playground.Û This discussion will consider the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies: What is the importance of unplanned green spaces? What types of ecologies can thrive in liminal, post-industrial landscapes, and why? How can we responsibly interact with and advocate for these spaces? What is the role of artists and creativity and community in these spaces? How can chance ecological landscapes becomes sites of new relational structures between humans, the environment and other species? What will happen to these spaces in the future, as the city faces challenges caused by rising sea levels and climate change?

You can come from ruins, yet not yourself be ruined. Social disintegration and existential desperation can be sources of life and creative energy. Our first hit rappers know something that Hegel said modern men and women had to learn: they know how to ÛÏlook the negative in the face and live with it.Û They have looked the ruins in the face, and they have lived with them, and they have come through. Now they can see and feel their way to new life.  ÛÒ Marshall Berman ÛÏNew York City: Seeing Through the RuinsÛ

Artist and activist Shellyne Rodriguez will be hosting a panel discussion that aims to trace back the peopleÛªs ongoing fight to remain in the Bronx. The event will cover the era of the slumlord fires, the subsequent redevelopment, as well as the most recent efforts to gentrify the Bronx via luxury developments, including an attempted renaming of the South Bronx and the art-washing that is plaguing major cities throughout the globe. Longtime tenants who survived the fires will give testimonials and veteran activists from Nos Quedamos, Mothers on the Move, and Take Back the Bronx will provide a historical context for the battle of the Bronx now raging between the community, developers, and the artists caught in between.

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, complementing the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016.

Participatory Workshops and Public Performances: October 16, 2016
Chance Ecologies Symposium: October 23, 2016

Chance Ecologies: Queens is an exhibit of new works, artistic gestures and research projects engaging with the undesigned and wild growing landscapes found in post-industrial sites, landfills and other liminal spaces around Queens. This exhibit brings together creative works from a large group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists, who have explored three of these sites around the borough over the past two years: HunterÛªs Point South, the Newtown Creek, and the Flushing River. Each of these places has its own unique history and landscape, but all three are united by a shared legacy of industrial pollution and human intervention.

Over the centuries, the Queens waterfront has been reshaped by successive waves of development and redevelopment, creating an entirely new urban coastline. Once a series of natural ecosystems, lined with streams and rivers, wetlands and forests, the shoreline is now home to power plants, highways, landfills, and new residential and commercial developments. However, several sections of this man-made waterfront have been temporarily reclaimed by nature, hovering between waves of development and real estate speculation, and have become unplanned green spaces. These unmanaged meadows, glens and marshes support a diversity of life not found in the cityÛªs official parks, providing an important habitat for wild species of birds, insects, trees and flowers, and upending our assumptions of human dominance in the city.

Chance Ecologies: Queens opens up the complex dialogues about the importance of these spaces by inviting artists and community members to creatively engage with them, both in the museum and in person. The artistsÛª of Chance Ecologies extensive, ongoing research and fieldwork explores the varieties of life found in these sites, while also articulating a deeper understanding of how the environment has been and continues to be radically reshaped by human impacts, including globalization and climate change. By bringing members of the public to these remote areas, to creatively engage with these artistic responses, Chance Ecologies celebrates the resilience of urban nature, and asks community members to consider their own place in the larger sphere of life.

Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a diverse array of artworks, from video installation and new media to sculpture and drawing, the results of collaborations between archaeologists, architects, filmmakers, urbanists and naturalists with community members of all ages and backgrounds. To expand the dialogue around this exhibit, Chance Ecologies will present a day of participatory art projects and public performances along the Flushing River on October 16th, and a symposium of authors, artists, academics and community groups at the museum on October 23rd. More information on those events will be announced at the Queens Museum website.

Chance Ecologies: Queens is curated by artists Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger, and includes work by many of the artists and thinkers who have been a part of Chance Ecologies, including Joianne Bittle, Daniel Campo, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Edrex Fontanilla, Dylan Gauthier, Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Chris Kennedy, Kristyna Milde, Marek Milde, Anne Percoco, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit), Raphaele Shirley, Marisa Tesauro, and Sarah Nelson Wright.

Chance Ecologies was created in 2015 by Catherine Grau, Nathan Kensinger and Stephen Zacks, and has been supported by the Queens Museum, ArtBuilt Mobile Studios and the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation with a residency at the Studio In The Park program, and has worked in partnership with Amplifier Inc., RadiatorArts, and the Newtown Creek Alliance.

About our Guide:

About the Co-presenter:

Julien A.Terrell was born, raised and currently lives in the West Harlem neighborhood where he first developed his interest in community and cultural organizing. His social justice work began in Buffalo working with local residents and activists to organize for the clean-up of Brownfield sites in low income communities of color and creating processes based in self determination and creative visioning.

Shortly after returning back to New York City in 2007, he started focusing on gentrification, environmental justice issues and looking at how creative planning principles can be used to preserve communal and cultural spaces that provide opportunities for inter-generational learning. In 2013 after working on solidarity projects in Cuba and Brazil, his commitment to developing youth leadership both locally and internationally motivated him to join The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, working until 2016, with young people to end police control in Harlem. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is a holistic youth development organization located in West Harlem dedicated to long term development of young people of color as long term critically thinking leaders. He continues to organize and work on community based art projects as part of the Harlem Copwatch Team and is the founder of the Renaissance Chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation.

The Laundromat Project (LP) amplifies the creativity that already exists within communities by using arts and culture to build community networks, solve problems, and enhance our sense of ownership in the places where we live, work, and grow. LP envisions a world in which artists are understood as valuable assets in every community and everyday people know the power of their own creative capacity to transform their lives, their relationships, and their surroundings.

West Queens,2016-09-25T13:00:00-0400,"A National Convening Around the Peace Table

To accompany the exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents Artists In/Of The City, a special convening that explores the current wave of new artist residency programs in city agencies taking place throughout the nation.

Beyond Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª almost four decade long artist residency within the NYC Department of Sanitation, NYCÛªs Department of Cultural Affairs has recently initiated artist residencies inside three other city agencies and is working on more. Cities around the country, including Boston, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, are experimenting with their own versions of residencies within municipal agencies and departments.

Artists In/Of The City convening provides an open space to share and discuss the aspirations and experiences of artists and their city agency partners involved in these kinds of residencies in NYC and across the country. WeÛªve also invited those in charge of organizing these residencies to share how they initiated and structured their residencies given their local contexts. We hope that these examples will illuminate the best ways moving forward to harness artistsÛª unique creative and critical contributions to how urban systems work.

The Artists In/Of The City convening starts with a brief examination by Ukeles of the artworks that inspired the event from the Touch Sanitation Show, 1984. Three works originally conceived for Touch Sanitation Show have been reimagined for the Queens Museum, and we will meet in front of One YearÛªs Worktime II, 1984/2016, a full year of work shifts in the form of clock faces has been silkscreened over a gradient of colors representing the seasons which is installed on the MuseumÛªs Large Wall in the Main Atrium. We will then assemble around the Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for UkelesÛªs installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it will be suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.

This setting for the convening, a literal round table, has inspired a format for the convening consisting of three concentric rings of guests. The first ring will be Presenters, artists and city officials with direct experience with residences at municipal agencies whose presentations will act as conversation starters for the convening. The second ring will be Respondents, other artists who have been asked to prepare questions to bring to the table that can deepen the conversation. The third ring will be Participants, other invited artists and the general public interested in the theme that can keep the conversation going with their own questions and comments during the convening.

Moderated by Queens Museum Director Laura Raicovich.

Confirmed guests for the convening include:

- Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Sanitation

West Queens,2016-09-18T15:00:00-0400,"Since the late 1960s, Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª performances, sculptural installations, and writing have explored issues profoundly important today: the role of women in society, cultures of work and labor, and the environment. Her Manifesto for Maintenance Art 1969! laid out the hidden, yet essential role of maintenance in Western societyÛÓand the radical implications of actively valuing rather than dismissing or hiding it.

Join us for the opening reception for the first survey of UkelesÛª work, organized by the Queens MuseumÛªs Larissa Harris with guest co-curator Patricia C. Phillips, who initiated the project in 2012. The show spans five decades, from UkelesÛª work as a pioneer of feminist performance to a practitioner of public art through which she invites us to reconsider indispensable urban systems and the workers who maintain them. Ukeles is undoubtedly best-known for her 38+ year role as the official, unsalaried Artist-in-Residence at New YorkÛªs Department of Sanitation. Unprecedented when it began in 1978, this residency has now become a model for municipalities engaging with artists as creative agents.

Please note the date/time is now Sunday, August 28 from 3:50-6pm.

ÛÏBlock after block, I keep trying to search for what lies beyond. Beyond my own neighborhood, beyond my awareness, beyond my self. I am searching for what the cityÛªs immigrant communities hold forth and hold back, recognizing that, as Alfred Kazin once said of lights along Jamaica Avenue, Û÷they were searching out so many new things in meÛª.ÛÛÓGarnette Cadogan, Round and Round

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas  at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016. Garnette CadoganÛªs essay Round and Round is a jumping off point for the map City of Walkers: Around the World in a Day by cartographer Molly Roy; both found in Nonstop Metropolis.  One spring afternoon in 2015, Cadogan set out from his home in the Bronx to take a twenty-four-hour walk around the city. Guided by the idea that the city is inexhaustible and its stories countless, he saw no end to his searchÛÓor our searching. And so he decided that a circular route was only fitting for New York, a place where mystery.

Diversity is central to New York CityÛªs lifeblood: the cityÛªs mix of people and perspectives and neighborhoods are its pulse and increase its vibrancy. And few neighborhoods demonstrate that as vividly as Flushing, Queens,  home to many vibrant immigrant communities. Flushing displays the cityÛªs diversity, but also demonstrates the power and resonance of its tolerance. What are the challenges of pluralismÛÓhow we live together in spite of our differencesÛÓand what are its joys?

Join us on a walk with Garnette Cadogan, editor-at-large for Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas and visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture to explore Flushing ÛÒ its history and impact in the story of pluralism ÛÒ then disperse to enjoy the manifold culinary delights of the neighborhood. He will be joined by R. Scott Hanson Ph.D., author of City of Gods: Religious Freedom, Immigration, and Pluralism in Flushing, Queens (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016).

A free copy of a printed broadside with the map and abridged version of the essay will be provided to all attendees.  You can also check out CadoganÛªs essay Walking While Black in advance of the walk: http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/

In February of 1964, 500, 000 black and Latinx students boycotted the New York City school system. Considered one of the largest demonstrations of the Civil Rights Movement, this is a forgotten story of leadership and coalition-building to fight racism and segregation in the education system. We invite you to learn about the Ûª64 boycott and the groups and organizations that participated ÛÒ including Latinx groups ÛÒ through historical documents like news clippings, news footage and archival documents from the archives of Bayard Rustin and Reverend Milton Galamison ÛÒ two activist leaders that spearheaded the boycott.  Watch clips from archival footage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkUbPJhy6A

Throughout the day we will also listen to members of the IMI Corona community share, through audio recordings, their experiences as students, parents and activists in the NYC education system, as an exercise in understanding our histories of struggle as continuous an interrelated.

Mil novecientos sesenta y cuatro uses 1964 ÛÒ the year of New York CityÛªs controversial WorldÛªs Fair- to surface and celebrate the legacy of educational justice activism in Corona, Queens, and New York City.

Smiley Bag Portrait is a participatory art project created by Nobutaka Aozaki who is currently a resident artist in the Queens Museum Studio Program. Nobu utilizes one of the most commonly used plastic bags with yellow smiley faces to draw the portraits of the public. The participants will get their free portrait bag with their names, date, location and artistÛªs signature as exchange. The project will travel to various locations in Queens, including: Corona Plaza, Jackson Heights Diversity Plaza, Flushing Library and Queens Museum.

Nobutaka Aozaki is a New York-based artist born in Kagoshima, Japan. He brings a wry and playful approach to his multifaceted practice, often focusing on the transactional nature of both art and life in the city. He completed his MFA at Hunter College in 2012. He has been awarded the Artist Files Grant from A Blade of Grass Foundation, and the ArtistsÛª Fellowship from New York Foundation for the Arts. Recent exhibitions include Transportation, ISCP, New York, Crossing Brooklyn, Brooklyn Museum, New York and Where Do We Migrate To?, Varmlands Museum, Karlstad, Sweden.

The Studio Program at the Queens Museum is made possible, in part, with support from The Scherman FoundationÛªs Katharine S. and Axel G. Rosin Fund. Additional support is provided by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.",1
West Queens,2016-08-06T13:00:00-0400,"Curated by Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs New York atlas Nonstop Metropolis at the Queens Museum in November 2016. Rebecca SolnitÛªs essay The Oysters In The Spire is a jumping off point for the map Wildlife by cartographer Molly Roy and artist Tino Rodriguez; both found in Nonstop Metropolis. The curators of Chance Ecologies have created a daylong event inspired by this essay and map.

The public is invited to join an international group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists from Chance Ecologies at a series of participatory actions and workshops in the wilderness along the banks of the Newtown Creek, one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States. Participants will be invited to creatively engage with urban wildlife, environmental activism, and art practices exploring industrialized landscapes. Participants will interact with a diverse range of species living in and along the creek, and with unique arts projects being developed on its shoreline by Chance Ecologies, a curatorial framework for artistic practices exploring unplanned, post-industrial wild spaces.

This day of activities will take place at the Plank Road project site, one of the only access points to the unplanned shoreline of the Newtown Creek, and is being presented in partnership with the Newtown Creek Alliance. Broadsides of the Rebecca Solnit essay and Wildlife map will be distributed to all attendees, courtesy of the Queens Museum.

Directions:
All events will begin at the intersection of 47th Street and 58th Road in Maspeth, Queens. This is a remote industrial location. Bring sturdy shoes. Water and shade will be provided. The nearest subway station is the L Train station at Grand Street, which is about a 20 minute walk (5 minute bike ride) east along Grand Avenue to 47th Street. The closest bus stop is at Grand Avenue and 47th Street on the Q59 route. Walk north on 47th Street for one block to reach the event site.

Schedule of Events:

Plank Road Welcome / Willis Elkins and Nathan Kensinger
1 ÛÒ 1:30pm
Chance Ecologies curator Nathan Kensinger and Newtown Creek Alliance (NCA) program manager Willis Elkins will introduce visitors to the Plank Road site, leading a walk along the shoreline. Elkins will discuss the work that the NCA is doing to create access and re-introduce species to the Newtown Creek, giving an overview of his Living Dock and Plank Road initiatives, while Kensinger will discuss how wildlife in and around the creek has inspired a variety of creative arts projects, from George TrakasÛª Nature Walk to recent public arts installations like The Newtown Creek Armada and Chance Ecologies. A field guide to local birds will be distributed, for visitors to seek their own inspiration onsite.

Virtual Reality, Empathy, and Place / Edrex Fontanilla
1:30pm to 4pm
New media artist Edrex Fontanilla will bring individual visitors into an immersive experience of the lost wilderness of HunterÛªs Point South, allowing participants to exist in a place that no longer exists. One by one, viewers will be brought to a secluded waterfront glen and given a virtual reality mask, to experience the sights and sounds of a unique, wild landscape that once stood along the Newtown Creek.

Maspeth Creek Voyage / Nathan Kensinger, Laura Chipley, Sarah Nelson Wright
1:30pm-4pm
Peer into a video porthole transporting you underneath the waters of the Newtown Creek and into the nearby environs of the Maspeth Creek inlet, where egrets, herons and barnacles scratch out an existence in the raw sewage of one of New York CityÛªs largest combined sewer overflows. This immersive video installation was originally created for The Newtown Creek Armada, a boat pond installed on the creek in 2012 at the Newtown Creek Nature Walk.

Dancing With Weeds / Lise Brenner
2-3pm
Choreographer Lise Brenner will lead a group of participants in creating a danceable map of the vegetation along the Newtown Creek at Plank Road, connecting movement, plants and landmarks. No dance experience necessary. Wear appropriate footwear.

The Wild Within / Dillon de Give
3pm-7pm
Walking artist Dillon de Give will organize short partnered walks bounded by mutual gaze. The Wild Within is an experiment in seeing each other, inspired by the following quote:

ÛÏSince that day, when I close my eyes I can see the pupils of the two rust-colored coyotes. There was something secret there, a wildness that didnÛªt belong to the coyote but that I recognized as my fundamental nature. It was who I was but it didnÛªt belong to me. It was the intelligence of all beings. It was uncultivated, unbiased, and unconditioned. It was true intelligence.Û ÛÒ Paul Rezendes, The Wild Within

Impossible Bridge / Edmund Mooney + Dylan Gauthier
3pm-5pm
A collaboration between artists Edmund Mooney and Dylan Gauthier, Impossible Bridge is a performance and floating sound sculpture that utilizes a hand-built boat and two hydrophones to create an underwater audio bridge to span the long-disused creek crossing at Plank Road.

Seed Collecting Walk / Ellie Irons and Anne Percoco
4pm and 5:30pm
A walk along the wild-growing banks of the Newtown Creek, to identify and gather seeds from the hardy plants that are thriving on the banks of this super-funded waterway. Collected seeds will become part of the Next Epoch Seed Library, an art installation which provides a diverse gene pool of weedy species, well-situated to face the Anthropocene era.

Undomesticated Species, Blindness & Bliss / Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)
6-7pm
As part of an ongoing film project at Plank Road, artist Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit) will arrange a sound performance by artist Tamio Shiraishi, based on the underlying script of her project. The audience is welcomed to sink into the sound and the existing environment of the Newtown Creek, as Shiraishi signals with his sound to the birds.

The Wild Call / Catherine Grau
7pm
A participatory performance piece designed by Chance Ecologies curator Catherine Grau. As a closing ceremony for the dayÛªs events, all present guests will be asked to silently walk onto the site, and perform an improvised collection of bird calls, howls and other wild sounds.Curated by Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger",1

Mierle Laderman Ukeles and the Museum have conceived a series of public programs meant to engage and contemporize some of Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance ArtÛªs important themes.

At 2,200+ acres, the Fresh Kills Landfill, which operated from 1948-2001, would span the equivalent of lower Manhattan to 34th Street and is nearly 3x the area of Central Park.  Participants will learn about the history of the site and gain the perspectives of the Sanitation and Parks Departments on the transformation of the landscape during those years, what is involved in re-purposing a former solid waste disposal facility of this scale into publicly accessible recreational space; current activities and visions for the future.

The first stop will be the site of Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª Percent for Art project for the future Freshkills South Park entitled Landing. Upon completion it will have  three components: the soaring, cantilevered Overlook and the two earthworks, Earth Bench and Earth Triangle. These three components will be connected by the newly graded and ADA-accessible landbridge whichÛÒ at nearly 500 feet long and some 32 feet above the tidal inlet belowÛÒconnects the two mounds that form South Park (a combined 147 acres).  This will be followed by visits to adjacent viewing areas to get different perspectives of the Landing site and appreciate the larger context of UkelesÛªs experiential art: framed by the cityÛªs Û÷landfill to landscapeÛ master plan, the site reveals the contradictions and unity of ÛÏman-made natureÛ and ÛÏman-made urbanism.""

Meeting Point: Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Staten Island side; Ramp E/ Taxi stand. You should be able to take the 11am ferry and join us at the bus by 11:30am.

Logistics: There will be a rest room stop. However, participants should bring their own nourishment (there will be no stops for food), dress warmly and wear sturdy shoes or boots. All visitors are required to sign waivers before entering the site.

West Queens,2016-11-13T14:00:00-0500,"What does zero waste to landfills by 2030 look like? A Maintenance Perspective

To accompany the current exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents a special convening that explores the NYC Department of SanitationÛªs ambitious 0x30 initiative to radically rework the CityÛªs garbage and recycling infrastructure. The convening features the perspective of voices that are rarely heard from but are critical to the success of this initiative: residential building supers.

There will be brief presentations by Larissa Harris of the Queens Museum, NYC Department of SanitationÛªs (DSNY) Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, Anthropologist in Residence Robin Nagle, and Artist in Residence, Mierle Laderman-Ukeles explaining the critical role maintenance work plays in achieving 0x30.

Additionally, we will witness a conversation between residential building maintenance staff to see how managing waste will maximize diversion in the cityÛªs residential buildings.

DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, ÛÏWhile many people view us, while the sanitation workers are out doing their job, they donÛªt actually see us. This is also true for the maintenance workers handling waste within the cityÛªs buildings before it gets to the curb. This conversation is an opportunity to bring to light a behind the scenes maintenance perspective for New Yorkers. It is an honor to be able to work with the Queens Museum on such an innovative exchange of ideas.Û

The special discussion will take place around Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for UkelesÛªs installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it is suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.

A screening of new video works by Joianne Bittle, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Dylan Gauthier, Nathan Kensinger, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, and Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)

Over the past two summers, the artists of Chance Ecologies have engaged with three different sites in Queens: HunterÛªs Point South, the Newtown Creek and the Flushing River. The works in this screening present a wide range of responses to these post-industrial sites, ranging from collaborative performances to solitary explorations, and employ a variety of film techniques, including stop motion animation, underwater recordings, and drone footage. Each of these films is a unique creation inspired by a different aspect of these landscapes, and when viewed together, they present a larger picture of the ideas informing Chance Ecologies. The screening will be following by a Q&A with the artists. Please click here for more information on the screenings: http://www.queensmuseum.org/2016/10/chance-ecologies-in-motion

The curators of Chance Ecologies will lead a walk-through of Chance Ecologies: Queens, the current exhibit in the Queens Museum Community Partnerships Gallery, giving an overview of the ideas behind Chance Ecologies. Several artists, include Kristyna and Marek Milde, Marisa Tesauro, and Joianne Bittle, will be present to give details about their individual works. Light refreshments will be provided.

2ÛÓ3:30pm: Creatively Engaging Chance Ecologies
Artist talks by Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright

Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a variety of creative approaches to engaging with flora and fauna found in post-industrial urban wildernesses. These artist talks will take a deeper look into three different approaches to the landscape, from walking to seed collecting to virtual reality.

Coyote Walk Project
Dillon de Give will speak about the Coyote Walk Itinerancy, a short walking residency which he has been leading annually for 8 years. Originally inspired by Hal, a wild coyote that appeared in New York City in 2006, the project examines and traces greenspace channels running through NYC and surrounding wilds. This talk will begin in the Community Partnerships Gallery, move to the Panorama of New York City, and end in the Queens Museum theater.

Vegetative Resistance: Weeds and Wildness in Human Dominated Landscapes
Ellie Irons works with cosmopolitan spontaneous plants that thrive in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. Often described as weeds, they provide a starting point for exploring nativeness, invasion, gentrification and the future of land use in the face of global climate change. As we concern ourselves with big questions of globalization, mass extinction, and climate change, we exert control in small ways by attempting to restore or cultivate landscape fragments to mimic historical ideals. As we pour resources into such measures, what are we losing, erasing, eradicating? Expanding from these questions, Irons will explore the tale of one particular weedy species: Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis), while raising questions about human and vegetative agency in the so-called Anthropocene.

Hidden Vistas: Empathy and Place in Virtual Reality Installations
What does it mean to have empathy for a place? How can we use cutting edge technologies such as virtual reality and 360å¡ video to immerse a viewer in places that no longer exist? That are too difficult to find? Too hazardous to visit? Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright share their creative process of applying ÛÏthe empathy machineÛ to wild geographies.

3:30ÛÓ4:30pm: Digging into Chance Ecologies
A public discussion led by the curators of Chance Ecologies and Daniel Campo

The closing event of this daylong symposium will open up a larger conversation amongst the artists and participants of Chance Ecologies, lead by co-curators Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger and by Daniel Campo, author of ÛÏThe Accidental Playground.Û This discussion will consider the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies: What is the importance of unplanned green spaces? What types of ecologies can thrive in liminal, post-industrial landscapes, and why? How can we responsibly interact with and advocate for these spaces? What is the role of artists and creativity and community in these spaces? How can chance ecological landscapes becomes sites of new relational structures between humans, the environment and other species? What will happen to these spaces in the future, as the city faces challenges caused by rising sea levels and climate change?

Location: The Point, 940 Garrison Ave., Bronx NY

You can come from ruins, yet not yourself be ruined. Social disintegration and existential desperation can be sources of life and creative energy. Our first hit rappers know something that Hegel said modern men and women had to learn: they know how to ÛÏlook the negative in the face and live with it.Û They have looked the ruins in the face, and they have lived with them, and they have come through. Now they can see and feel their way to new life.  ÛÒ Marshall Berman ÛÏNew York City: Seeing Through the RuinsÛ

Artist and activist Shellyne Rodriguez will be hosting a panel discussion that aims to trace back the peopleÛªs ongoing fight to remain in the Bronx. The event will cover the era of the slumlord fires, the subsequent redevelopment, as well as the most recent efforts to gentrify the Bronx via luxury developments, including an attempted renaming of the South Bronx and the art-washing that is plaguing major cities throughout the globe. Longtime tenants who survived the fires will give testimonials and veteran activists from Nos Quedamos, Mothers on the Move, and Take Back the Bronx will provide a historical context for the battle of the Bronx now raging between the community, developers, and the artists caught in between.

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, complementing the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016. Marshall BermanÛªs essay ÛÏNew York City: Seeing Through the RuinsÛÛ is a jumping off point for the map Burning Down & Rising Up:The Bronx in the 1970s by cartographer Molly Roy and artist Lady Pink; both found in Nonstop Metropolis.

Opening Reception & Walkthrough with Curators & Artists: October 8, 2pm-4pm
Participatory Workshops and Public Performances: October 16, 2016
Chance Ecologies Symposium: October 23, 2016

Chance Ecologies: Queens is an exhibit of new works, artistic gestures and research projects engaging with the undesigned and wild growing landscapes found in post-industrial sites, landfills and other liminal spaces around Queens. This exhibit brings together creative works from a large group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists, who have explored three of these sites around the borough over the past two years: HunterÛªs Point South, the Newtown Creek, and the Flushing River. Each of these places has its own unique history and landscape, but all three are united by a shared legacy of industrial pollution and human intervention.

Over the centuries, the Queens waterfront has been reshaped by successive waves of development and redevelopment, creating an entirely new urban coastline. Once a series of natural ecosystems, lined with streams and rivers, wetlands and forests, the shoreline is now home to power plants, highways, landfills, and new residential and commercial developments. However, several sections of this man-made waterfront have been temporarily reclaimed by nature, hovering between waves of development and real estate speculation, and have become unplanned green spaces. These unmanaged meadows, glens and marshes support a diversity of life not found in the cityÛªs official parks, providing an important habitat for wild species of birds, insects, trees and flowers, and upending our assumptions of human dominance in the city.

Chance Ecologies: Queens opens up the complex dialogues about the importance of these spaces by inviting artists and community members to creatively engage with them, both in the museum and in person. The artistsÛª of Chance Ecologies extensive, ongoing research and fieldwork explores the varieties of life found in these sites, while also articulating a deeper understanding of how the environment has been and continues to be radically reshaped by human impacts, including globalization and climate change. By bringing members of the public to these remote areas, to creatively engage with these artistic responses, Chance Ecologies celebrates the resilience of urban nature, and asks community members to consider their own place in the larger sphere of life.

Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a diverse array of artworks, from video installation and new media to sculpture and drawing, the results of collaborations between archaeologists, architects, filmmakers, urbanists and naturalists with community members of all ages and backgrounds. To expand the dialogue around this exhibit, Chance Ecologies will present a day of participatory art projects and public performances along the Flushing River on October 16th, and a symposium of authors, artists, academics and community groups at the museum on October 23rd. More information on those events will be announced at the Queens Museum website.

Chance Ecologies: Queens is curated by artists Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger, and includes work by many of the artists and thinkers who have been a part of Chance Ecologies, including Joianne Bittle, Daniel Campo, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Edrex Fontanilla, Dylan Gauthier, Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Chris Kennedy, Kristyna Milde, Marek Milde, Anne Percoco, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit), Raphaele Shirley, Marisa Tesauro, and Sarah Nelson Wright.

Chance Ecologies was created in 2015 by Catherine Grau, Nathan Kensinger and Stephen Zacks, and has been supported by the Queens Museum, ArtBuilt Mobile Studios and the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation with a residency at the Studio In The Park program, and has worked in partnership with Amplifier Inc., RadiatorArts, and the Newtown Creek Alliance.

ÛÏGarveyÛªs Black Star Line made only a few voyages . . .

Many seekers from the diasporic cosmos have journeyed to and from Harlem in search of all things sacred and secularÛÓJesus and jazz, Allah and hip-hop, freedom and fame.Û ÛÒ Christina Zanfagna, ÛÏHome to HarlemÛ

Community Organizer and Harlem native Julien A. Terrell,  will lead an interactive walk focusing on HarlemÛªs past as a local and international hub for political strategy and creative action. Sites will include Hotel Teresa, Lenox Lounge, Malcolm X Outreach Corner, and more. Given the ongoing waves of gentrification and political repression, this walk will also touch upon current cultural organizing efforts such as the Yuri and Malcolm Mural Project and future opportunities to honor the legacy of Harlem.

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016.

About our Guide:

About the Co-presenter:

Julien A.Terrell was born, raised and currently lives in the West Harlem neighborhood where he first developed his interest in community and cultural organizing. His social justice work began in Buffalo working with local residents and activists to organize for the clean-up of Brownfield sites in low income communities of color and creating processes based in self determination and creative visioning.

Shortly after returning back to New York City in 2007, he started focusing on gentrification, environmental justice issues and looking at how creative planning principles can be used to preserve communal and cultural spaces that provide opportunities for inter-generational learning. In 2013 after working on solidarity projects in Cuba and Brazil, his commitment to developing youth leadership both locally and internationally motivated him to join The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, working until 2016, with young people to end police control in Harlem. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is a holistic youth development organization located in West Harlem dedicated to long term development of young people of color as long term critically thinking leaders. He continues to organize and work on community based art projects as part of the Harlem Copwatch Team and is the founder of the Renaissance Chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation.

The Laundromat Project (LP) amplifies the creativity that already exists within communities by using arts and culture to build community networks, solve problems, and enhance our sense of ownership in the places where we live, work, and grow. LP envisions a world in which artists are understood as valuable assets in every community and everyday people know the power of their own creative capacity to transform their lives, their relationships, and their surroundings.

West Queens,2016-09-25T13:00:00-0400,"A National Convening Around the Peace Table

To accompany the exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents Artists In/Of The City, a special convening that explores the current wave of new artist residency programs in city agencies taking place throughout the nation.

Beyond Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª almost four decade long artist residency within the NYC Department of Sanitation, NYCÛªs Department of Cultural Affairs has recently initiated artist residencies inside three other city agencies and is working on more. Cities around the country, including Boston, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, are experimenting with their own versions of residencies within municipal agencies and departments.

Artists In/Of The City convening provides an open space to share and discuss the aspirations and experiences of artists and their city agency partners involved in these kinds of residencies in NYC and across the country. WeÛªve also invited those in charge of organizing these residencies to share how they initiated and structured their residencies given their local contexts. We hope that these examples will illuminate the best ways moving forward to harness artistsÛª unique creative and critical contributions to how urban systems work.

The Artists In/Of The City convening starts with a brief examination by Ukeles of the artworks that inspired the event from the Touch Sanitation Show, 1984. Three works originally conceived for Touch Sanitation Show have been reimagined for the Queens Museum, and we will meet in front of One YearÛªs Worktime II, 1984/2016, a full year of work shifts in the form of clock faces has been silkscreened over a gradient of colors representing the seasons which is installed on the MuseumÛªs Large Wall in the Main Atrium. We will then assemble around the Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for UkelesÛªs installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it will be suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.

This setting for the convening, a literal round table, has inspired a format for the convening consisting of three concentric rings of guests. The first ring will be Presenters, artists and city officials with direct experience with residences at municipal agencies whose presentations will act as conversation starters for the convening. The second ring will be Respondents, other artists who have been asked to prepare questions to bring to the table that can deepen the conversation. The third ring will be Participants, other invited artists and the general public interested in the theme that can keep the conversation going with their own questions and comments during the convening.

Moderated by Queens Museum Director Laura Raicovich.

- Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Sanitation
- Vito Turso, Deputy Commissioner of Public Information at NYC Department of Sanitation

West Queens,2016-09-18T15:00:00-0400,"Since the late 1960s, Mierle Laderman UkelesÛª performances, sculptural installations, and writing have explored issues profoundly important today: the role of women in society, cultures of work and labor, and the environment. Her Manifesto for Maintenance Art 1969! laid out the hidden, yet essential role of maintenance in Western societyÛÓand the radical implications of actively valuing rather than dismissing or hiding it.

Join us for the opening reception for the first survey of UkelesÛª work, organized by the Queens MuseumÛªs Larissa Harris with guest co-curator Patricia C. Phillips, who initiated the project in 2012. The show spans five decades, from UkelesÛª work as a pioneer of feminist performance to a practitioner of public art through which she invites us to reconsider indispensable urban systems and the workers who maintain them. Ukeles is undoubtedly best-known for her 38+ year role as the official, unsalaried Artist-in-Residence at New YorkÛªs Department of Sanitation. Unprecedented when it began in 1978, this residency has now become a model for municipalities engaging with artists as creative agents.

Please note the date/time is now Sunday, August 28 from 3:50-6pm.

ÛÏBlock after block, I keep trying to search for what lies beyond. Beyond my own neighborhood, beyond my awareness, beyond my self. I am searching for what the cityÛªs immigrant communities hold forth and hold back, recognizing that, as Alfred Kazin once said of lights along Jamaica Avenue, Û÷they were searching out so many new things in meÛª.ÛÛÓGarnette Cadogan, Round and Round

This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-SchapiroÛªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas  at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016. Garnette CadoganÛªs essay Round and Round is a jumping off point for the map City of Walkers: Around the World in a Day by cartographer Molly Roy; both found in Nonstop Metropolis.  One spring afternoon in 2015, Cadogan set out from his home in the Bronx to take a twenty-four-hour walk around the city. Guided by the idea that the city is inexhaustible and its stories countless, he saw no end to his searchÛÓor our searching. And so he decided that a circular route was only fitting for New York, a place where mystery.

Diversity is central to New York CityÛªs lifeblood: the cityÛªs mix of people and perspectives and neighborhoods are its pulse and increase its vibrancy. And few neighborhoods demonstrate that as vividly as Flushing, Queens,  home to many vibrant immigrant communities. Flushing displays the cityÛªs diversity, but also demonstrates the power and resonance of its tolerance. What are the challenges of pluralismÛÓhow we live together in spite of our differencesÛÓand what are its joys?

Join us on a walk with Garnette Cadogan, editor-at-large for Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas and visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture to explore Flushing ÛÒ its history and impact in the story of pluralism ÛÒ then disperse to enjoy the manifold culinary delights of the neighborhood. He will be joined by R. Scott Hanson Ph.D., author of City of Gods: Religious Freedom, Immigration, and Pluralism in Flushing, Queens (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016).

A free copy of a printed broadside with the map and abridged version of the essay will be provided to all attendees.  You can also check out CadoganÛªs essay Walking While Black in advance of the walk: http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/

Location: Immigrant Movement International ÛÒ Corona, 108-59 Roosevelt Avenue, Corona, NY 11368. Near the 111th Street Stop on the 7 Train.

In February of 1964, 500, 000 black and Latinx students boycotted the New York City school system. Considered one of the largest demonstrations of the Civil Rights Movement, this is a forgotten story of leadership and coalition-building to fight racism and segregation in the education system. We invite you to learn about the Ûª64 boycott and the groups and organizations that participated ÛÒ including Latinx groups ÛÒ through historical documents like news clippings, news footage and archival documents from the archives of Bayard Rustin and Reverend Milton Galamison ÛÒ two activist leaders that spearheaded the boycott.  Watch clips from archival footage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkUbPJhy6A

Throughout the day we will also listen to members of the IMI Corona community share, through audio recordings, their experiences as students, parents and activists in the NYC education system, as an exercise in understanding our histories of struggle as continuous an interrelated.

Mil novecientos sesenta y cuatro uses 1964 ÛÒ the year of New York CityÛªs controversial WorldÛªs Fair- to surface and celebrate the legacy of educational justice activism in Corona, Queens, and New York City.  By activating the collective memory of black and brown struggles we hope to inspire and expand our communityÛªs sense of belonging and power. This project developed as part of an artist residency at Immigrant Movement International ÛÒ Corona and is the product of consultation with the IMI community.

ÛÏSince that day, when I close my eyes I can see the pupils of the two rust-colored coyotes. There was something secret there, a wildness that didnÛªt belong to the coyote but that I recognized as my fundamental nature. It was who I was but it didnÛªt belong to me. It was the intelligence of all beings. It was uncultivated, unbiased, and unconditioned. It was true intelligence.Û ÛÒ Paul Rezendes, The Wild Within

Impossible Bridge / Edmund Mooney + Dylan Gauthier

Oddo will host a mobile mammography van outside of Borough Hall on Thursday, May 8, 2014, beginning at 9am. The screenings will be available to women ages 40 and older who have not had a mammogram in the past year.

ÛÏWomen need to be made aware of risk factors and see a doctor ÛÒ they need to take care of themselves too, so they can be there for their families,Û noted Marion Smith, RN, Cancer Program Coordinator at Richmond University Medical Center.  

Mammograms are still the best way to detect changes and disease, Island experts agree. ÛÏMammograms are important preventative measures for women. The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,Û noted Borough President Oddo. ÛÏBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.Û

In addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  ÛÏAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,Û noted Ms. Smith. ÛÏWomen are afraid, they donÛªt want to know.Û

But knowing is exactly what can save their lives.

The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

In addition, a mini-womenÛªs health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the MayorÛªs Office to Combat Domestic Violence.

All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening.",1

Screening of Documentary ÛÏPANE AMARO (Bitter Bread): The Italian American Journey from Despised Immigrants to Honored Citizens by Gianfranco Norelli and Suma Kurien

The story is told by weaving together comments by noted American scholars with personal accounts from members of the community and through the use of a treasure trove of historical photographs and footage.  Filmmakers Gianfranco Norelli and Suma Kurien will be on hand to introduce the film and conduct a post screening Q & A. 

The suggested donation is $20. Wine, Cheese and light fare will be served.

Oddo will host a mobile mammography van outside of Borough Hall on Thursday, May 8, 2014, beginning at 9am. The screenings will be available to women ages 40 and older who have not had a mammogram in the past year.

ÛÏWomen need to be made aware of risk factors and see a doctor ÛÒ they need to take care of themselves too, so they can be there for their families,Û noted Marion Smith, RN, Cancer Program Coordinator at Richmond University Medical Center.  

Mammograms are still the best way to detect changes and disease, Island experts agree. ÛÏMammograms are important preventative measures for women. The earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat,Û noted Borough President Oddo. ÛÏBy providing these screenings, we want to encourage Staten Islanders to focus on their health. Despite studies to contrary, experts on Staten Island are continuing to talk about the importance of mammograms. Women should speak to their doctors to determine whether their risk factors require such screening.Û

In addition, resources for women undergoing breast cancer treatment abound on Staten Island. At RUMC, a Patient Navigator program has been in full swing for several years to help usher women through the process from diagnosis through treatment to restored health. Particularly vulnerable, the navigators say, are African American women.  ÛÏAfrican American women tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage,Û noted Ms. Smith. ÛÏWomen are afraid, they donÛªt want to know.Û

But knowing is exactly what can save their lives.

The mobile mammograms will be funded by Cancer Services Program of Staten Island, Richmond County Savings Foundation, Avon Foundation Breast Care Fund, and The Greater NYC Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

In addition, a mini-womenÛªs health fair will be on site, including HealthPlus, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island University Hospital, information on mastectomy bra fittings and wigs, and the MayorÛªs Office to Combat Domestic Violence.

All insurance plans will be accepted, and co-pays and deductibles will be waived. The mammograms will be free to uninsured women. Anyone who is eligible should call (800) 564-6868 to make an appointment for a screening.",1

Protectors will provide bags and tools. In case of rain this event will be postponed until the 26th.  Teenagers are welcome to participate but they need to be accompanied by or have written consent of an adult.
