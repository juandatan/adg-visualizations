ART_EVENT,"Graffiti vs Street Art: A History, is an historical exhibition intended to clearly present the fact that, although  being blanketed under the terms Street Art or Urban Art, Graffiti and Street Art are actually two very different things. Simply put, this Graffiti is calligraphic. This Street Art is primarily image based,  or when textual, conceptual. Of course, people have written and drawn on walls ever since the walls were caves, rocks, clay, or just dirt. This exhibit,  concerns popular contemporary urban formats. Inspired by the attention that the calligraphically oriented classic graffiti writers-who adopted self appointed monikers as did the hip hop musicians of the day, a later generation of artists took to the streets in order to take advantage of the exposure the writers had experienced. This show is not a comprehensive overview but a selection of graffiti writers who rose to prominence during its ‰ÛÏgolden era‰Ûù of the 1970s, and the most prolific street artists who subsequently developed the form from the mid/late ‰Û÷70s through the early 1980s. Graffiti vs Street Art: A History, features significant artist from both sides of the coin.  Al Diaz(Bomb One, Samo*) co-curator, selected the following graffiti writers to participate; Samo*, Bomb One, Snake -1, Flint, Jester, Tracy 168, & Lee. The following street artist were selected by co-curator Christopher Hart Chambers(avant*); avant*, Scot Borofsky, Linus Coraggio, Richard Hambleton, Ken Hiratsuka, RV, Dan Witz, & Keith Haring.*Samo was a duo including Al Diaz and Jean-Michelle Basquiat**avant was a group of as many as twelve individual artists.

ART_EVENT,"‰ÛÏOne splendid artist, Anton Petrov, loves walking the streets of St. Petersburg always in search of the absolute; letting himself to soak into the atmosphere of many colors, shapesand dynamics of ever changing city‰Ûù‰Û_ Being just a little child, Anton would express a great interest to the fine art. The inception of that enthusiasm still noted in some of his recent works: the way he conveyed his vision - beautiful strokes of expressionism are mesmerizingindeed! Especially it is well distinctive in his painting ‰ÛÏPortugal‰Ûªs port‰ÛÏ and ‰ÛÏThe Dream‰Ûù.After Anton‰Ûªs realization that the Art is his true call, he went to the Russian Academy of Arts in one of the most sophisticated cities ‰ÛÒ St. Petersburg. As any artist, he has a unique way of sharing his thoughts with the world on the canvas. Some of hislife statements certainly have influenced it: ‰ÛÏInspiration is a very elusive phenomenon, you simply have to love the feel of the brush in your hand to keep creating‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏFearless process of daydreaming and work‰Û_‰Ûù- that is where we find Realism theme in his works, such as ‰ÛÏA girl with apples‰Ûù, ‰ÛÏThe Hunters‰Ûù.During his years in Academy Anton has always been very vigorous and diligent. He participated in over a 10 big art competitions that brought him an awards and certain fame. Because of such hard work and talent, part of the artist‰Ûªs paintings were succefully sold to some private house collections in Russia.As it is appropriate for any artistic spirit, Anton followed his art-fervor to NYC to explore a new horizon, culture and trends. ‰ÛÏOne splendid artist is now walking the streets of Manhattan‰Û_‰Ûù",1,ART_EVENT

NIGHTLIFE,"Good Room presents...The Range (DJ set)Jim-E Stack (DJ set)Doctor JeepTickets - $10 advanced or $15 at the doorDoors 10pm / +21 gigFollowing the release of his latest album, Potential earlier this year, The Range returns to Good Room. Potential is a record steeped in histories ‰ÛÒ of its characters, of its forebears ‰ÛÒ but is startlingly new and alive: the network may be ones and zeros but the circuitry here runs on blood, still.James Hinton made the computer his primary instrument after falling under the spell of Baltimore club, bringing in his broader sonic influences from early ‰Û÷90s jungle, early ‰Û÷00s grime and mid ‰Û÷00s electronica to a new sonic whole. The software was the thing at home, but what excited the young producer was the network, and where he spiraled was YouTube. Potential uses as its backbone a series of vocal samples that Hinton has found in the forgotten corners of the site, guiding us around the hinterlands of YouTube, introducing us to unknown artists expressing themselves unfettered by the constraints of industry, lost in the infinite potential of an audience unknown.He will be joined by Jim-E Stack. Jim-E Stack has always had a knack taking a wild and assorted set of influences and filtering them into a coherent, heartfelt sound. Currently based out of New York, Jim-E Stack perfected his own sound one that synthesizes everything from 90s house to Baltimore club. Initially, Jim-E Stack has built a following on the strength of his early singles and EPs on labels like Body High and Good Years and his remixes for the likes of Sky Ferreira and A$AP Rocky. This year he released two singles, 'Dreamt' and 'Deadstream' as well as a cover of BjÌ_rk's 'Hyperballad' featuring Lower Dens singer Jana Hunter.Listenhttps://soundcloud.com/therangemusichttps://soundcloud.com/jimestack",0,NIGHTLIFE

Having stripped back his release schedule , somewhat defiantly hitting out with just a couple of self-released singles that hinted at a more vivid approach to his production this year, he‰Ûªs truly taken his DJing global with his performances reaching as far afield as Asia, South America and Australia. Having lectured at the Red Bull Music Academy in Madrid, released a critically heralded FABRICLIVE compilation and remixed artists like Radiohead, The xx and M.I.A., Kennedy‰Ûªs also found the time to run the vinyl only club night, Acetate, in Leeds and help ensure that Hessle Audio‰Ûªs weekly radio show on London‰Ûªs Rinse FM maintains its role as an essential part of the station‰Ûªs broadcasting schedule. ANTHONY NAPLESAnthony Naples is a musician and DJ from Miami, Florida, living in New York City.

He spends his weekends on planes and trains (he actually prefers driving a car) to carry a bag of records to prized clubs like Robert Johnson, Fabric, Plastic People, Trouw or Sub Club on the regular. His very own selection of well-made and often newly laid house music that knows its roots as well as it is yearning for the future or explores the leftfield, is what you can expect from him. You can also reappraise his methods (and love for other music) on each of his specifically created and applauded mix shows that float the net. All of this is presented and custom-made for your pleasure with the loving hands of a working DJ.Paris born, Tokyo raised NYC based international eclectic french DJ, producer and international co-ordinator.

MUSIC_EVENT,"Good Room presents...ChairliftMr Twin SisterJunglepussyTickets have sold outFree afterparty from midnightTickets at: http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1381225ChairliftCritically acclaimed pop duo Chairlift has released new music in the form of the infinitely danceable ‰ÛÏCh-Ching.‰Ûù The R&B laced, vibrating drum infused pop track serves as the first musical offering from their forthcoming album Moth, which was released in January 2016 via Columbia Records. Although the single is the first work to be released from Chairlift in three years, the duo ‰ÛÒ comprised of writer/producers and multi-instrumentalists Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly ‰ÛÒ has hardly been quiet. They collaborated with BeyoncÌ© on her groundbreaking self-titled album via the track ‰ÛÏNo Angel,‰Ûù which was written and produced by Caroline and co-produced by Patrick. Caroline released and toured Arcadia, a self-produced solo album under the alias Ramona Lisa and collaborated with SBTRKT, Blood Orange and others, while Patrick produced and collaborated with artists such as Solange Knowles, Wet, Kelela, and Tei Shi.An evolution from their last album, 2012‰Ûªs Something, Moth proves to be an emotionally uninhibited and markedly stronger, more pop inspired body of work. A very New York City inspired album, listeners can expect to be led through an aural mix of big, rich pop inspired hooks, vibrating bass, lively brass and sensuous R&B inspired vocals, all anchored in the duo‰Ûªs meticulously crafted instrumentation.Mr Twin Sister""Twin Sister are a Brooklyn-by-way-of-Long Island quintet that do so much so well. Their songs have a remarkable sense of atmosphere and romanticism. They nod at their heroes-- maybe Stereolab and Bjork, maybe Cocteau Twins or 1980s pop-- without overtly stealing. They seem to know they are capable of great things..."" - PitchforkThe band's self-titled album is the second full length album by the five members of Twin Sister, now known as Mr Twin Sister. Following their debut LP, composed largely in a studio, the band returned to the creative process they had employed on their first two EPs- working individually or in small, shifting groups. Ideas germinated in an environment where experimentation was encouraged. Some bloomed immediately, others matured slowly over the years, the rest demolished and rebuilt dozens of times in an effort to discover their ideal form. Progress was slow, coming in fits and bursts, accommodating the unexpected twists and turns of life.JunglepussyBrooklyn rapper Junglepussy, known for her fiery lyrics that pack a punch and her unapologetic attitude, first started making music at the end of 2012. Since then she‰Ûªs released two projects, Satisfaction Guaranteed and Pregnant with Success, given talks at Yale, Columbia, and NYU, licensed her music for Comedy Central‰Ûªs Broad City, and walked in the DKNY fashion show. She's been cosigned by everyone from Diddy and Erykah Badu to Action Bronson and Le1f, and played shows with Lil Kim, Nelly Furtato, Travis Scott, Solange, and Dev Hynes. ‰ÛÏJunglepussy means business, and she‰Ûªs got the talent to back it up. With a raw sexuality and a strong message about female autonomy and empowerment, she‰Ûªs a modern Lil Kim.‰Ûù",1,MUSIC_EVENT
NIGHTLIFE,"Good Room presents...Metro AreaBenoit & Sergio (live)Justin Miller+The Almond Brothers in the Bad RoomTickets - $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the doorDoors - 11pm / +21 gigMETRO AREAThe brainchild of veteran producers Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani, Metro Area was born out of the pair‰Ûªs somewhat dichotomous love for both the classic moods of R&B, disco and boogie and innovative, modern dance music.  Metro Area brings back the soulful experimentation of the early club classics, mixing live and electronic instruments.  Simultaneously, the mood and minimalism of more recent forms creep into the mix: Detroit's cold futurism, Chicago's abstract track-modes, the warmth of New York and New Jersey's deep house and the experimentation of brave pop music.  All of these influences combine with the duo‰Ûªs unique perspective to create a distinctive sound that is unmistakably their own.BENOIT & SERGIOBenoit & Sergio produce dance songs that sometimes seem like musical open letters; editorials narrated in the voices of unidentified, yet totally recognizable colorful characters, read aloud against a backdrop of beautifully lush, warm and sensuous electronic pop music. The French/US duo met at an after party in Berlin, and it wasn‰Ûªt long before their signature combination of rich synth work combined with pop influenced lyrical magic and impressive songwriting had been released on labels such as Spectral Sound, DFA, Visionquest, Hot Creations and Culprit.JUSTIN MILLERJustin Miller is a quintessential New York City DJ. Mixing the classically cool with the always-cool and the brand new, he‰Ûªs a selector whose tastes spread across best of techno, deep house, and disco new and old. Part of that diversity likely comes from his tenure as DFA Records assistant label manager and sole employee for seven years, guiding the seminal NYC label through one of its most fruitful periods. After leaving DFA he started Have A Killer Time Recordings and is now the head of Deus Records.THE ALMOND BROTHERSAn accident turned happy when their nut roasting carts convened outside the fabled Mangiami many moons ago.  Three long lost brothers decided to team up and take their veritable idiot circus around the world for schnitz and wiggles.

Influenced by his hometown staples (Axis, Purpose Maker, M Plant, and UR) along with international labels like Perlon, Playhouse, and early Kompakt, Ryan inhabits his kick drums, becoming an extension of the music and vice versa.MIGUEL SENQUIZDetroit native Miguel Senquiz has artfully crafted a unique voice from a rich musical background. With roots firmly established in the gravitas of the area‰Ûªs heritage, he‰Ûªs incorporated a unique soulful texture and a polished-but-scuffed aesthetic aided in part by his connection to the Ghostly family. Growing up and seeing legends like Richie Hawtin, Delano Smih and Derrick Carter, He‰Ûªs used that experience and knowledge to hone in on his own sound, gaining a reputation for long and energetic sets threading, and sometimes blurring the lines of house, techno, and acid.PARRISH SMITHParrish Smith crafts a sound that‰Ûªs both familiar and deeply inexplicable. Hovering between body music, electronica and deep-burning jakbeat yet rejecting the conventions of all three, his output is as elusive as it is absorbing. Inspired by personal experiences and his determination to keep evolving, Smith developed a distinctive sound derived from an all-analogue set-up, sampling every object that produces sound.Tickets $10 advanced or $15 at the doorDoors 10pm / +21 gigListenhttps://soundcloud.com/ryan-elliotthttps://soundcloud.com/htmiguelhttps://soundcloud.com/parrishsmith",1,MUSIC_EVENT

NIGHTLIFE,"Good Room presents...Lindstrom (live)JoakimBarbie Bertisch+ NaduveFacets in the Bad RoomLindstrÌümLike one of his endlessly building tracks, Hans-Peter LindstrÌüm is only moving further upwards. The Norwegian space-disco wizard‰Ûªs new EP, Windings, is three tracks of that now-classic sound closely associated with LindstrÌüm‰Ûªs name: skyward synths, effervescent rhythms, and melodies that spiral beautifully into the great unknown. This is LindstrÌüm in the zone‰ÛÓand if you‰Ûªve been paying close attention over the last decade, it‰Ûªs a zone he‰Ûªs never left.Recorded over the past year, Windings represents LindstrÌüm‰Ûªs latest crystallization of the aesthetic that the greater world was introduced to on the 2006 compilation It‰Ûªs a Feedelity Affair, as well as the tangy pop of 2012‰Ûªs masterful Smalhans. This isn‰Ûªt to say LindstrÌüm‰Ûªs repeating himself‰ÛÓfar from it, in fact. Windings finds our arpeggiator-obsessed hero refining an aesthetic that already sounded perfect‰ÛÓa zenith that, much like the music itself, hits new peaks even when it seems that there‰Ûªs no more ceiling to breach.JoakimSince his beginnings in 1999, Joakim has taken great efforts to avoid being pigeonholed and has grown on the outskirts of the French Touch and international Club scenes, becoming one of their major players and an ever surprising outsider. Year after year, Joakim has gathered experiences that confirm his global vision of music and explored many facets of the musical spectrum: a musician with five albums under his belt; a label founder and manager (the fantastic Tigersushi and the recent vinyl-only Crowdspacer imprint)From Fantoíâmes in 2003, deviating house music from the end of the 90‰Ûªs, to Nothing Gold in 2011, a vision of pop music as defined by the DFA label, and the more cerebral, frosty and metallic Monsters & Silly Songs in 2006, Joakim has left his fingerprints on current electro, modernizing and hybridizing it, with no concern for schools and genres, taking his inspiration from new wave as well as krautrock, noise and disco, soul and pop, ambient and house.Barbie BertischBorn & raised in Buenos Aires, Brooklyn resident Barbie Bertisch emerged with a passion for genre-bending dance music. Her ever-growing record collection ranges from ambient, fusion & crossover jazz, latin grooves with a flair for afrobeat, cosmic, left-field, house and soulful disco delight. She is also a frequent collaborator on dance music zine Love Injection, co-hosts its monthly namesake radio show on Dublab, has a weekly show on The Lot Radio, and is part of NYC's Classic Album Sundays family.NaduveNaduve is the already told story of an Indie rock Accordion player turned on acid into an Analog Synth pornographer. After a boot camp as the resident DJ at the late MICHATRONIX nano club and DJing as a regular at Tel Aviv‰Ûªs clubs like The Block, Bootleg, Breakfast Club and many more, he is about to release his new works on labels like Cocktail D‰Ûªamore and Disco Halal. Apart from that nonsense he also takes place in the 84%Creativity (of Malka Tuti label) collective who took the mission of bringing joy the darkest corners of Tel Aviv and His live project - (Shame On Us) along with Yovav Arzi and Alek Lee.Tickets $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the doorDoors - 10pm / +21 gigListen - https://soundcloud.com/feedelityhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimbouazizhttps://www.mixcloud.com/barbie-bertisch/https://soundcloud.com/naduve",0,NIGHTLIFE

This night brings a long overdue debut from Detroit, making their first appearance in New York City with a much heralded Live PA, we are delighted to host Aux88.  Their history spans from the present back to the mid 80s when Tommy Hamilton was working with Juan Atkins on various projects with the seminal Metroplex imprint, 430 West, and with Keith Tucker, their own Puzzlebox Records. In the mid 90s, following forays into solo projects, Aux88 reformed to the present day incarnation.  Their bass heavy electro is a definitively Detroit sound.  In recent years the duo has made several key appearances at international festivals including Dekmantel, Movement, and Awakenings.  Their performance is not to be missed. Chicago native Justin Long adds his talents to the bill with an all vinyl set.  Smart Bar Chicago's senior resident hosts one of the city's most heralded underground events, Hugo Ball, which champions exclusively all vinyl sets and caters to the dancefloor, not the Internet.  As a producer, Long has recently embarked on his collaborative project on Brooklyn Imprint LIES, Circling Vultures with Ken Zawacki that debuted earlier this year. As one of the most dynamic and creative Djs from the Windy City, we are honored to have him for this event. TrÌ_ SkÌ_l founder  Kimyon rounds out the lineup in the Good Room. He has been busy in the studio with recent releases on Metroplex and a remix on Crosstown Rebels, both appearing this year.  His imprint No Agenda releases its first EP before the end of the year, a 12 inch featuring local siren Bridgit Barkan.  The Bad Room hosts Lauren Flax, the Detroit native and Brooklyn transplant, who is celebrating her upcoming release on Nervous Records.  Local hero Turtle Bugg rounds out the talent for the night.",0,NIGHTLIFE
NIGHTLIFE,"Good Room presents...Kevin SaundersonContakt+Love Tempo in the Bad Room withJustin Strauss & DJ Billy CaldwellKEVIN SAUNDERSONPlatinum-selling recording artist, label boss, festival promoter, true innovator in the pantheon of popular music, cultural champion, cracking DJ: there‰Ûªs a lot to be said about Kevin Saunderson. His influence runs deep, through both adopted hometown of Detroit, and music culture as a whole: as one of the Belleville Three, the high school trio which also includes Juan Atkins and Derrick May, he irreparably changed the face of electronic music; with Inner City, he gave it some of its most memorable tunes.His nickname of ‰Û÷The Elevator‰Ûª is apt: for his role in transporting Detroit‰Ûªs new sound to a wider audience; as anyone who has seen him perform live can attest, his high-energy, high-spirit and high-impact DJ sets; and for spending the past 35 years of his life progressing the culture he helped create. Operating in tandem to his golden run as a producer in the late 80s and early 90s, Saunderson‰Ûªs own KMS record label ‰ÛÒ a remarkable 30 years strong in 2017 ‰ÛÒ has chronicled the early footsteps of R-Tyme, Blake Baxter, MK, Chez Damier, Derrick Carter, Bicep and even Saunderson‰Ûªs son and regular DJ partner Dantiez more recently.CONTAKTInitially introduced to techno and house by witnessing awe inspiring sets from Detroit hometown heroes such as BMG, Mike Clark, and Robert Hood at illegal parties around Michigan, Contakt has quietly smuggled the Motor City‰Ûªs refusal to stick to just one of those two genres to NYC via his floor-filling DJ sets, co-founding and curating the forward thinking Brooklyn club night TURRBOTAXå¨, and producing 12‰Ûùs for labels like Argot, Icee Hot, and Local Action that refuse to be categorized in a single genre. LOVE TEMPOGood Room residents Love Tempo are back in the Bad Room for a night of Balearic, house, acid, cosmic, new wave, disco and whatever else they pull out of their record bags. The night will be helmed by to legends of the scene, Justin Strauss and Billy Caldwell.Justin Strauss has spent more than three decades at the forefront of the NYC dance scene. Starting as DJ at New York‰Ûªs legendary Mudd Club, he spun his way through The Ritz, Limelight, Area, Tunnel, M.K., Life, Centro Fly and more, pioneering his own distinctive sound, and becoming one of the most sought-after remixers and producers not just in New York, but in the world. Billy Caldwell made his name at Manchester U.Ks legendary HOME , Hacienda & Paradise Factory Clubs‰Ûª as well as co founding and DJing at the Infamous 'Epping Walk After Hours' Party in his native Manchester England.Tickets - $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the door +21 gig Listen - https://soundcloud.com/kevinsaunderson",0,NIGHTLIFE

Since the release of 2015's ""Good Heavens"", which was Monogold's acoustic-based effort, they have torn down any preconceived notions that they or anyone else had of them. After completely stripping down their sound for ""Good Heavens"", the Monogold boys took this new foundation of simplicity and started building with their signature, catchy power-trio melodies and hooks. They still like to go deep on the lush soundscapes, but their songs have become a bit more focused and driven by the instrumentation and the vocals. With their new EP, Kelly, Apuzzo, and Falotico are giving the world a small taste of what is to come in the future of the band. The four song EP is a prelude to another full length record which is in the process of being mixed right now.

Okay, stop trying‰ÛÓ you‰Ûªre going to hurt yourself. Let The Hollows do it for you. They‰Ûªre fully aware that they‰Ûªre standing on the shoulders of giants, and they‰Ûªre blazing a path ahead with the musical equivalent of a flamethrower. These frontiersmen of the New York City roots-rock scene have been creating an old sound that sounds new‰ÛÓ or maybe the other way around‰ÛÓ since 2009.When you first see The Hollows take the stage, you will find them out of place. They will appear to be a ragtag set of traveling performers, accustomed to closing out barn dances and just as likely to steal your prize-winning cow as to wake up next to your sister in a hayloft. It will seem to you that they woke up, one confused morning, to find themselves instead on a Brooklyn street corner.But when the first notes reach your ears, whether from a sweet and breezy mandolin, a whiskey-tuned banjo, or an unrepentant guitar, it will seem to you that the sound of The Hollows is uniquely New York: a contradictory, harmonic melting pot that takes all of its roots, twists them around, and produces something else, something new. This scruffy ensemble of multi-instrumentalists, made up of Justin Aaronson, Jeffrey Kurtze, Daniel Kwiatkowski, Rob Morrison, David Paarlberg, and Erik Saxvik, might just as soon swap glockenspiels, trumpets, and harmonicas as plug in a squawking electric guitar or an airy, spacey synthesizer. The result is a veritable junkyard of instruments and musical personalities, a carnival on wheels, a one-man band in six bodies that owns the stage with all the mobile, rhythmic ease of a seasoned railroad gang.When The Hollows first began performing together, they quickly produced a diverse output of material that attracted a local following through several monthly residencies at Pete‰Ûªs Candy Store, the intimate, longtime Brooklyn venue that served as a launch pad for acts like Will Oldham, Devendra Banhart, Dirty Projectors, and many more. As word spread, the crowds grew, the venues grew to match, and in 2011, The Hollows captured the attention of audiences and reviewers alike with their debut release, Belong to the Land.  Critics called the album, recorded at The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY, an ‰ÛÏoutstanding offering‰Ûù made by ‰ÛÏmaster craftsmen,‰Ûù ‰ÛÏbrilliantly executed‰Û_ a joy to listen to,‰Ûù an ‰ÛÏincredible debut effort,‰Ûù and simply ‰ÛÏa monster.‰Ûù  The band‰Ûªs artistic production moved beyond the musical with the release of their first video, ‰ÛÏPoor Eyes,‰Ûù in 2012, and the song was later highlighted in the soundtrack to Bob Giraldi‰Ûªs short film ‰ÛÏA Poet Long Ago‰Ûù in 2013.  (Additional tracks from Belong to the Land also appear in the 2013 feature film Twenty Million People and 2014‰Ûªs Sun Belt Express.)Less than a year later, the band continued its ‰ÛÏmassive momentum‰Ûù with the release of a self-titled EP, tracked at Brooklyn‰Ûªs Grand Street Recording and Galaxy Smith Studios, and featured on Spinner, The Huffington Post, MSN, WCBS FM, and MP3.com. A second music video, ‰ÛÏAugust,‰Ûù premiered a few months later.  By now, the band was known for its ‰ÛÏecstatic live shows‰Ûù and the ‰ÛÏmelodic, fiery hoedown‰Ûù they inspired, which prompted the release of a live album, Neverending Show, in 2013: a ‰ÛÏfresh breath of true musician sprit‰Ûù that offered a ‰ÛÏsoulful, powerful and thick sound‰Ûù and captured ‰ÛÏeverything that makes seeing The Hollows live in concert so much fun.‰ÛùOn June 3rd, The Hollows will release their second full-length album, Between the Water and the Wonder Wheel, tracked at The Bunker in Brooklyn with producer John Siket [Sonic Youth, Phish, Yo La Tengo, Dave Matthews Band], engineered by James Frazee [Beck, Patti Smith, Esperanza Spalding], and mastered by Fred Kevorkian [Willie Nelson, Ryan Adams, The White Stripes].  It kicks off with ‰ÛÏMountains to the Sea,‰Ûù an anthemic blend of folk and raw electricity that catapults the listener into the rest of the album, which is at times thoughtful and meditative; others rollicking and boisterous.  ‰ÛÏJamestown,‰Ûù with its soaring classic rock sensibility, hits hard.  ‰ÛÏHumpback Heart‰Ûù will make you want to drive a pickup across the country, only to get out and dance on the side of the road.  ‰ÛÏCross Country Call‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏMidnight Band‰Ûù seem to channel ghosts.   ‰ÛÏThe Ballad of Jack and Vi‰Ûù is a love song with a range and ambition that could only come from The Hollows, with a crooked cast of characters and a sonic atmosphere that whisks you through the rivers and backwoods of Americana.  The final track, ‰ÛÏPioneers,‰Ûù rises slowly from the earth and burns up into the night sky, the ashes fading like a daybreak dream.This summer, The Hollows will hit the ground running with their first national tour, with 30 shows announced in 20 states, and more on the way. When you catch them in action, you‰Ûªll see an unpredictable barn-burner full of high-octane foot-stomping and exuberant odes to love on the rocks, life on the lam, death on the road, and the fact that there‰Ûªs still a place in music where fallen angels, risen devils, and even the seediest of back bar characters can all live together in six-part harmony.  You‰Ûªll dive into the flood and awake drenched the next morning, with a fire in your belly and a song in your head‰ÛÓ surprised to find you had a hootenanny hidden in your toes.GOLDENCHILDhttp://www.goldenchildband.com/https://www.facebook.com/goldenchildbandBrooklyn-based, Florida-born songwriters Wiley Gaby & Jeffrey Doker set out to carve a space where their seemingly disparate influences could meet, mingle, and ultimately blur genre lines to create beautiful new music. Influenced by classic country storytelling, melancholy pop melodies, and pretty things, the duo formed Goldenchild in the spring of 2014, and will release their debut album, Bridges, this fall.With a handful of original tunes ready to record, Doker & Gaby tapped rock producer/engineer Mark Ephraim, whose previous credits include work with The New Pornographers, Ed Vallance, & Au Revoir Simone, to name a few. Ephraim‰Ûªs darker production paired with the songwriters‰Ûª country-influenced melodies yielded a haunting, evocative, and more rock-tinged sound.Joined by a stellar roster of guest players such as Parker Kindred (Antony & The Johnsons, Joan As Policewoman, Jeff Buckley) on drums, Jon Rauhouse (Neko Case) & Ed Kurz (Tatter & Rags) on pedal steel, Caleb Lindskoog (The Silver State, Magmana) on electric guitar, and many others, Ephraim and Goldenchild‰Ûªs core personnel‰ÛÓGaby, Doker, guitarist Jeff Mensch, vocalist Kerry Flanagan, and multi-instrumentalist James Power‰ÛÓrecorded Bridges throughout north Brooklyn between 2014 and 2015. On their debut album, Goldenchild merges elements of classic country and ambient soundscapes with a respectable hint of pop sensibility. The result is ‰ÛÏgorgeous, cosmic country‰Ûù that NYC‰Ûªs Next magazine calls ‰ÛÏdamn beautiful.‰ÛùPhil Pickenshttp://www.philpickens.com/https://www.facebook.com/philpickensmusic/?fref=tsRecently featured on NPR Music and WFUV: A southern gentleman by way of Manhattan, he'll take you to the moon (or at least take your heart there).

BOOK_EVENT,"A Neck the Glove Takes Hold Ofan evening of poets, performance, and musicWednesday, Dec 7Doors at 7:30 PM / Begins at 8:30 PMFeaturing:The legendary poet Sara Deniz AkantThe dress up ritual induced its practitioner to a state of possession, whereby the language of the third presence, a battery operated companion doll, was reencoded into American English. Legendary performances now raise these outputs from the book's pages into the air.The legendary performer Andy BraddockA complex of potentials marked from its youth for media archaeology is confounded by what has been unearthed and already underway. A practiced body gradually discloses its own processes to itself, always pre-individually seeking its own vanquishment.The legendary poet Joey Yearous-AlgozinCorrupt and incomplete analysis of the foundational bedrock caused the bridge to collapse, and the troll has escaped. It's on them that the people, immersed in vats of Dissipative Imperial Playlist, cannot realize that this is what's happening to them, and are incapable of saying, ""the troll has escaped.""The legendary musicians Carolyn Hietter and Sydney VilesWhile the theremin translates cartesian positionality into sombre quanta, the saxophone gazes into the diaphragm to find its definition. The musicians belonging to these instruments discovered each other at the ever mysterious NYC Constellation Ensemble.Now announcing joining this astonishing bill:Carolyn Hietter, saxophonist and Sydney Viles, thereminist!Imagine your own oblique description for these two legendary performers!",1,BOOK_EVENT

MUSIC_EVENT,"""Leningrad, also known as Gruppirovka Leningrad, is a popular Russian rock band from Saint Petersburg, led by Sergey """"Shnur"""" Shnurov. Composed of 14 members, the band appeared first in the late 1990s. They soon became famous for their vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons they were avoided by most radio stations at first. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made their way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the prohibited words), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. Over the years popularity grew tremendously and after many TV and Film features, countless concerts and festival appearances all over the world, Leningrad is now one of the most renowned and legendary Russian bands attracting stadium-size crowds.""",1,MUSIC_EVENT

LECTURE,"Register here for free tickets to this event: artistsatthecrossroads.eventbrite.comJoin us for the second ‰Û÷Artists at the Crossroads‰Ûª talk to hear the winter and spring residents present their residencies and join in conversation with fellow resident artist R. Luke DuBois and future resident artists Mendi + Keith, moderated by Adam Sternbergh, Cultural Editor at New York Magazine.During the Winter 2015-2016 residency, visualist/software designer Joshue Ott and composer Kenneth Kirschner collaborated to research and develop mobile technologies for visual and sound art with the ultimate goal of creating a free, publicly available smartphone app. Through public engagement, research and digital collection, they created soundscapes and a new iteration of their variant app series, variant:breaker.In Spring 2016, Joseph Keckler set out to challenge New Yorkers‰Ûª supposed rejection of Times Square and their claims to ‰ÛÏnever go there,‰Ûù by lurking around and looking for locals he recognized to ask questions. As the approach became passive observation, his practice shifted indoors. From a small, ubiquitous office on 46th Street, he created a rehearsal studio, writing room and even film set.For Spring 2017, musician/artist/writers Mendi + Keith Obadike will interweave Times Square's geography with a vocal interpretation of its unique soundscape to create an interactive navigational tool that allows visitors to compose their own harmonies while walking around the neighborhood.Residency at the Crossroads is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative residency program, in which artists are invited to experiment and engage with Times Square‰Ûªs unique urban identity and users. Launched in Summer 2015, the program hosted a series of four three-five month residencies for New York City-based artists, infusing artists into the thriving urban commercial district of Times Square in order to creatively investigate its identity and usage through observation, experimentation, engagement and documentation. The results are often different than the original intent, thus strengthening the argument for process-driven programs such as this.

Guardian Alien's video selection includes footage of their epic trip to Antarctica, with serene long shots of blue glaciers and congregations of penguins. Priests presents a dreamy sequence of bedroom scenes, staged from props found around thrift stores in their hometown of Washington DC.BiosScreaming Females is an American independent rock band, from New Brunswick, New Jersey. They have released six full length albums. The band features Marissa Paternoster on guitar and vocals, Jarrett Dougherty on drums, and King Mike on bass. Their 2015 album, Rose Mountain - Don Giovanni, is a milestone in a number of ways. Screaming Females had such a clear goal for their new album that it became almost a mantra: they wanted songs that were concise, crisp and melodic. Not only does the album reflect a new approach to the band‰Ûªs songwriting, the LP marks the first time Screaming Females have worked with an outside producer, and also marks 10 years of playing together. This ten year period has taken the band from playing basement shows in their hometown of New Brunswick to touring with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Ted Leo & the Pharmacists and Garbage, who teamed with Screaming Females to record a cover of Patti Smith‰Ûªs Because the Night. They have been featured on NPR and performed on Last Call With Carson Daly, building an audience without losing the focus and drive that inspired them in the first place.Comprised of prolific New York experimental musicians Greg Fox and Alex Drewchin, Guardian Alien is an ever evolving, far reaching, avant-garde machine. With equal nods to 80s minimal no wave and mid 2000s skronk, the duo effortlessly fuses the old and new schools of musical vocabulary in their kaleidoscopic explorations. Moving past foregone conclusions, they arrive in uncharted territory, where new discoveries can be made.Priests is a 4 piece band from Washington DC. They have released two tapes and first single, Radiation/Personal Planes, on their own Sister Polygon record label. Bodies and Control and Money and Power is an EP co-released with Sister Polygon and Don Giovanni Records. The band is currently at work on their debut full length.Faye Orlove is an illustrator and animator living in Los Angeles. She is the co-creator of Fvck the Media, an online platform that covers alternative arts, culture, music, news, and grassroots activism.

BOOK_EVENT,"The panel will examine Donald Judd‰Ûªs relationship to the written word over the four decades contained in the new publication. The panel will include: Flavin Judd, Curator and Co-President of Judd Foundation, co-editor of Donald Judd Writings, and son of Donald Judd; Roberta Smith, Co-Chief Art Critic of The New York Times; Ann Temkin, Marie-JosÌ©e and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art. Moderated by Michael Govan, CEO and Wallis Annenberg Director of The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.Donald Judd Writings, co-published by Judd Foundation and David Zwirner Books, is the most comprehensive collection of the artist's writings assembled to date. Available in November 2016, this timely publication includes Judd‰Ûªs best-known essays, as well as little-known texts previously published in limited editions. Moreover, this new collection includes unpublished college essays and hundreds of never-before-seen notes, a critical but unknown part of Judd‰Ûªs writing practice. Judd‰Ûªs earliest published writing, consisting largely of reviews for hire, defined the terms of art criticism in the 1960s, but his essays as a graduate student at Columbia, published here for the first time, contain the seeds of his later writing, and allow readers to trace the development of his critical style. The writings that followed Judd‰Ûªs early reviews are no less significant art-historically, but have been relegated to smaller publications and have remained largely unavailable until now. The largest addition of newly available material is a collection of Judd‰Ûªs unpublished notes‰ÛÓtranscribed from his handwritten accounts of and reactions to subjects ranging from the politics of his time to the literary texts he admired most. In these intimate reflections we see Judd‰Ûªs thinking at his least mediated‰ÛÓa mind continuing to grapple with questions of its moment, thinking them through, changing positions, and demonstrating the intensity of thought that continues to make Judd such a formidable presence in contemporary art.",1,BOOK_EVENT

ART_EVENT,"One Night Only: Rachel Feinstein's The Last Days of Folly, a performance festival organized by the artist, will mark the final days of her exhibition in Madison Square Park. Weds., 9/3, 5:30PM to 8:30PM. View the schedule of performances here: http://goo.gl/0yFZzLMore info about the all-star lineup at http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/the-last-days-of-follyMadison Square Park Conservancy today announced that Rachel Feinstein‰Ûªs Folly, three large-scale aluminum sculptures inspired by the artist-designed sets of the Ballets Russes, the improvisational spirit of the Commedia dell‰ÛªArte, and decorative architecture commissioned by royals, will provide the backdrop for an evening of live performances, transforming Madison Square Park into a public theater on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Marking the final days of Feinstein‰Ûªs Folly (open to the public through September 7, 2014), an exhibition of large scale sculptures that look like they could have come from a giant book of set designs but are, in fact, made of aluminum, will provide a fitting theatrical stage for a series of performances by contemporary artists, opera singers, musicians, puppets, dancers and more including:    MY BARBARIANMy Barbarian will present Broke Baroque Suite, an original operetta discussing topics of economics and art. The performers collaborate in chorus and solo numbers, including an aria by a soprano titled ‰ÛÏI, Object,‰Ûù a baritone/tenor duet called ‰ÛÏThe Artisan‰Ûªs Lament,‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏThe Five Seasons,‰Ûù a dance-song. The audience will be involved in an improvisational incarnation of fortune- and future-telling.ALLISON BRAINARD and CARA CHANReferencing Commedia dell‰Ûªarte styles, Allison Brainard will choreograph a group of seven performers acting as harlequins. The performers will lead a raucous procession, travelling around the perimeter of the park and playfully moving park goers through the performance sites. They will enact simple improvised scores with each other, forming static tableaus and interacting with several instruments and sculptural elements created by Cara Chan. JARVIS COCKERInspired by Maurice Ravel‰Ûªs Daphnis et ChloÌ© for the Ballets Russes, Jarvis Cocker has created a musical interlude that will serve as a segue between the performances on the stage at Feinstein‰Ûªs Cliff House.SOFIA COPPOLAFilm Director Sofia Coppola, in collaboration with Joffrey Ballet School‰Ûªs Director Jo Matos, and choreographer Irene Hogarth-Cimino and six young ballerinas will orchestrate a dance performance in response to the backdrop of Feinstein‰Ûªs Cliff House. The ballerinas will dance to Isao Tomita‰Ûªs re-orchestration of Claude Debussy‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏArabesque‰Ûù. TAMAR ETTUN AND THE MOVING COMPANYTamar Ettun will stage a performance piece incorporating five colorful, simultaneously occurring sculptural and sound events. Six ‰ÛÏmovers‰Ûù will attempt to accomplish durational physical tasks while negotiating Feinstein‰Ûªs outdoor sculptures, inflatable handmade balloons, and one another. Using a system of traditional rituals paired with postmodern dance concepts and gestures, the piece reflects on the human body in relation to deconstruction and stillness.LITTLE DID PRODUCTIONSAs Feinstein‰Ûªs Folly brings European architecture from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to Madison Square Park, Little Did Productions will bring fourth-century BCE India to Folly with verses from the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. Incorporating colorful overhead projections with found images from Indian shadow puppet theater, Little Did‰Ûªs narrator and co-artistic director, Luke Santy, in collaboration with Jessica Lorence, will lend sitar and vocal accompaniment to images projected onto Feinstein‰Ûªs Rococo Hut.LIL BUCK with PAUL CANTELON and WOLFRAM KOESSELLil Buck is a Los Angeles-based street performer who specializes in jookin‰Ûª. He will perform two improvised dances in front of Feinstein‰Ûªs Cliff House, accompanied by Paul Cantelon on piano and Wolfram Koessel on cello.KALUP LINZY with MIKE JACKSONRomantic Loner One Life To Heal is a visual musical melodrama of torch songs performed live by Kalup Linzy as characters Kaye Braswell and Taiwan Braswell, Kaye‰Ûªs presumed-dead cousin. Both are members of the fictitious Queen Rose family, who feature in Linzy‰Ûªs soap opera video series Conversations Wit De Churen, Melody Set Me Free, and As Da Art World Might Turns. The compositions are taken from Linzy‰Ûªs musical visual projects Sweetberry Sonnet and Romantic Loner, released in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The performance will also include portions of 2013's Conversations Wit De Churen X: One Life To Heal and will include live musical accompaniment by Mike Jackson.MOLLY LOWESensuality meets the grotesque in Molly Lowe‰Ûªs performance beneath Feinstein‰Ûªs Flying Ship. Relating the sense of touch and impressions of space, performers will don one large costume made of many nude suits sewn together, forming an undulating blob.ANGELA MCCLUSKEY and PAUL CANTELONSinger/composer duo Angela McCluskey and Paul Cantelon will present a series of musical performances from their extensive archive. In addition, they will perform a new original score inspired by Feinstein‰Ûªs Folly.SHANA MOULTON with NICK HALLETT and DAISY PRESSShana Moulton will activate Rachel Feinstein's Rococo Hut sculpture with a musical performance that includes interactive video projections, yoghurt, cat toys and massage tools. Composer Nick Hallett will sing original music with vocalist Daisy Press to accompany the performance.TONY OURSLER and CONSTANCE DEJONGInspired by his childhood sailing along the Hudson River, along with his admiration of the Hudson River School of American painters, Tony Oursler, in collaboration with Constance DeJong, will present a new video projection of an animated fantasy on Feinstein‰Ûªs Flying Ship.CARLOS VELA-PRADOWithin the context of the historical ‰ÛÏfolly‰Ûù premise, Carlos Vela-Prado will install inconspicuous sculptures and wireless speakers throughout Madison Square Park. They will emit soft-spoken voices, contributing to a soundscape that combines 1950s love songs, Fellini soundtracks, and traditional baroque strings with ambient and contemporary music. Vela-Prado‰Ûªs audio selections will be restructured and mixed such as to confuse the individual parts while extending and incorporating each other into a textured ballad for Feinstein‰Ûªs sculptures and the evening‰Ûªs audience. Additionally, Feinstein has embarked on collaborations with some of today‰Ûªs most notable fashion designers, including Giles Deacon, Duro Olowu, Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez, Cynthia Rowley, Proenza Schouler, and Madeline Weinrib. Each designer will create a new Folly-inspired look, to be presented in unexpected ways alongside the festival performances as they unfold. Giles Deacon will create a new dress for Rachel Feinstein to wear throughout her Last Days of Folly performance festival. The dress will be inspired by Marie Antoinette and Folly, Feinstein‰Ûªs exhibition at Madison Square Park.Duro Olowu will display a runway piece from his Spring 2008 collection. His model will travel throughout the park over the course of the evening.Zac Posen will use the park‰Ûªs Oval Lawn as a performative runway.

The interaction with people is what makes the sculptures pop. I became inspired to curate a performance festival using live theatre, colorful costumes, and different movements, forms and shapes to juxtapose the flatness, stillness, and whiteness of my sculptures,‰Ûù Feinstein explains. ‰ÛÏBeing an artist is a solitary process, and through working with other artists I admire and who are successful in their different fields to make this festival happen I have learned so much.‰Ûù  ‰ÛÏRachel Feinstein has long wanted to activate, through public performances, her three sculptures in Madison Square Park,‰Ûù said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, Martin Friedman Senior Curator at the Conservancy. ‰ÛÏShe has organized an exciting and diverse group of artists, designers, musicians, puppeteers and dancers to program an evening akin to one of her primary inspirations, Commedia dell‰Ûªarte.‰ÛùThe Last Days of Folly takes place at Madison Square Park, 23rd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, on Wednesday, September 3 from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Rain or shine. About Folly:Rachel Feinstein‰Ûªs Folly (on view in Madison Square Park through September 7, 2014), the artist‰Ûªs first public art exhibition in the United States, consists of three monumental sculptures that evoke the architectural ‰ÛÏfollies‰Ûù for which they are named ‰ÛÒ structures built with decorative rather than functional purpose, most popular in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century landscape design. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff, a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a mast extending to the ground. Feinstein‰Ûªs sculptures reference theatrical sources like Ballets Russes backdrops and Commedia dell‰Ûªarte stories, and their effect is that of a Fellini film set dropped into the middle of New York City. Feinstein‰Ûªs exhibition allows park goers to stumble into surprising cinematic worlds.",1,ART_EVENT

WORKSHOP,"Sn. Shivakripa,a karma Sannyasi and Shikshaka of Atmadarshana yogashram, Bengaluru, India.Pranayama is not just breathing practices, and prana is not just air that we breath. Breath is the external manifestation of prana, and prana is that subtle energy that can be enhanced with breath. Breathing exercises only oxygenate our bodies, whereas pranayama practices awaken the prana Shakti within us.Pranayama is a science which is related to our breath and more so to the subtle flowing energies in this breath, which is known as prana. Prana exists within each one of us in a dormant form. When we practice pranayama, the quantity of this vital energy in the body is activated to a higher frequency, gearing us towards maintaining a healthy body and mind.Diseases are the manifestation of an imbalance in the flow of prana within us. Pranayama reduces these blockages and replaces them with more and more prana, resulting in balance and harmony within and outside us.At the physical level, these practices help in controlling and alleviating high blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, rheumatism, bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cholesterol, fat, headaches, sinusitis, and various other ailments caused due to shallow breathing. At the spiritual level, these practices are said to be a direct link to our higher consciousness, the Paramatma.All participants please make sure to wear natural fiber clothes, and ensure that your last meal is 3 hours prior to the workshop.Register Here!http://reflectionsyoga.com/event/pranayama/",1,WORKSHOP

Her masterful portraits, dragons and erotic sketches - sold under the name of her father - are coveted by upper crust Lords and journeyman print makers alike.

BOOK_EVENT,"What can fashionable ideas, blind faith, or pure fantasy possibly have to do with the scientific quest to understand the universe? Surely, theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends, dogmatic beliefs, or flights of fancy? In fact, acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else. In this provocative book, he argues that fashion, faith, and fantasy, while sometimes productive and even essential in physics, may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas‰ÛÓstring theory, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. A book signing will follow.Roger Penrose, the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics Emeritus at the University of Oxford, is one the world‰Ûªs foremost theoretical physicists and has won numerous prizes, including the Albert Einstein Medal, for his fundamental contributions to general relativity and cosmology. Among other publications, he is the bestselling author, with Stephen Hawking, of The Nature of Space and Time (Princeton).",1,BOOK_EVENT

MUSIC_EVENT,"Gamelan Son of Lion is a repertory ensemble that bridges two musical worlds: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia. The instruments are from Indonesia with home-made additions. The music is written by the group of composer-performers, each in their unique styles, as well as traditional music of Bali and Java.Gamelan Son of Lion ‰ÛÒ which is based on New York City - bridges two musical words: experimental contemporary America and the bright gongs of Indonesia, employing instruments from Indonesia with homemade additions. There are about 100 active gamelan ensembles in the United States, and Gamelan Son of Lion rates among the oldest of these, having performed continuously for 40 years. It is also one of the few in this country that operate independently of institutions as a professional music ensemble.The New York Times described the ensemble as ‰ÛÏthe most prominent New York-area manifestation of a fascinating nationwide movement.‰Ûù The ensemble ‰ÛÒ which was co-founded by a trip of composers, Barbara Benary, Daniel Goode, and Philip Corner in the 1970s, and became incorporated in 1980 ‰ÛÒ has routinely performed experimental works by Indonesian composers, many involving gamelan with electronic music, and several theatre works involving opera, wayang kulit, multimedia and dance.At Flushing Town Hall‰Ûªs event, performers will include: Barbara Benary (Artistic Director) , David Demnitz, Daniel Goode, Nicholas Klinovsky, Jody Kruskal, Skip LaPlante,  Laura Liben, Layne Negrin, Myles Robert, Larry Simon and Sima Wolf.‰ÛÏOur ensemble, unlike orchestras, is a democratic affair in which most of the musicians can play most of the instruments, and do switch parts frequently with different compositions,‰Ûù says Co-founder Barbara Benary. ‰ÛÏSo no one is the soloist and many people are.‰ÛùTickets: $16/$10 Members & Students",1,MUSIC_EVENT

WORKSHOP,"Sensei Erik Paulson‰Ûªs martial arts journey began in 1974, in Judo. From there, he went on to train in the disciplines of Freestyle and Greco-Roman Wrestling, Boxing, Jeet Kune Do, Filipino Martial Arts (Kali/Eskrima/Arnis), Shoot Wrestling, and Brazilian JiuJitsu. Erik is world renown for his grappling, and is considered a leading authority in MMA.Erik is the founder of CSW (Combat Submission Wrestling) and STX Kickboxing (Savate-Thai Crosstraining). Besides Heading CSW Training Center in Fullerton Ca., Erik has also written a book ‰ÛÏHistory of American Submission Wrestling, and was a coach of Team Lesnar on The Ultimate Fighter, Season 13.Saturday June 7th - STX KICKBOXING -This hybrid striking system developed by Erik Paulson focuses on explosive techniques in Boxing, Panatukan, Jun Fan/JKD Kickboxing, Savate, and Muay Thai (Thai & Dutch methods).  In STX Kickboxing, students will learn a blend of elbows, punches and knees from each art. These skills are easily translated in MMA, kickboxing, and self-defense situations.  From glove drills, focus mitts, Thai-pads, and sparring, students will have a variety of striking options.Sunday June 8th - Combat Submission Wrestling -Erik‰Ûªs system (CSW) blends Judo, Freestyle Wrestling, and Greco-Roman Wrestling with techniques and submissions from Shootwrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, and Catch Wrestling. CSW trains the individual to strike, clinch, takedown, and submit on the ground in either a sport, mixed martial art, or self-defense environment. It is laden with painful submission hold and a plethora of devastating leg locks. The evolved style provides the perfect compliment to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.",1,WORKSHOP

In 2003, Leckey‰Ûªs first Sound System performance, 'BigBoxStatueAction' at Tate Britain, featured one of his speaker towers with Jacob Epstein‰Ûªs classic modernist sculpture, Jacob and the Angel (1940-41), blasting songs ranging from the Beach Boys‰Ûª ‰ÛÏOur Prayer‰Ûù to Throbbing Gristle‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏPersuasion.‰Ûù  In doing so Leckey contrasted Epstein‰Ûªs massive alabaster sculpture, inherently static, silent and invariable with the fleeting, continuously changing and invisible material that is sound. Far from a critique of sculpture, Leckey considers this acoustic set-up a different form of art appreciation: one that is intuitive and communal.Following the performance, Leckey will speak with two of the exhibition‰Ûªs curators, Peter Eleey, Curator and Associate Director of Exhibitions and Programs, MoMA PS1, and Stuart Comer, Chief Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art.",1,ART_EVENT

ART_EVENT,"What does zero waste to landfills by 2030 look like? A Maintenance PerspectiveTo accompany the current exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents a special convening that explores the NYC Department of Sanitation‰Ûªs ambitious 0x30 initiative to radically rework the City‰Ûªs garbage and recycling infrastructure. The convening features the perspective of voices that are rarely heard from but are critical to the success of this initiative: residential building supers.There will be brief presentations by Larissa Harris of the Queens Museum, NYC Department of Sanitation‰Ûªs (DSNY) Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, Anthropologist in Residence Robin Nagle, and Artist in Residence, Mierle Laderman-Ukeles explaining the critical role maintenance work plays in achieving 0x30.Additionally, we will witness a conversation between residential building maintenance staff to see how managing waste will maximize diversion in the city‰Ûªs residential buildings.DSNY Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, ‰ÛÏWhile many people view us, while the sanitation workers are out doing their job, they don‰Ûªt actually see us. This is also true for the maintenance workers handling waste within the city‰Ûªs buildings before it gets to the curb. This conversation is an opportunity to bring to light a behind the scenes maintenance perspective for New Yorkers.

ART_EVENT,"Chance Ecologies: Queens is an exhibit of new works, artistic gestures and research projects engaging with the undesigned and wild growing landscapes found in post-industrial sites, landfills and other liminal spaces around Queens, which will be on view at the Queens Museum‰Ûªs Community Partnerships Gallery from October 8th to 30th. As part of this exhibit, please join the artists and curators of Chance Ecologies on Sunday October 23rd for a public symposium, composed of film screenings, artist talks, and a facilitated public discussion about the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies. The Chance Ecologies Symposium will take place inside the theatre of the Queens Museum, and in the Community Partnership Gallery.12-1:30pm: Chance Ecologies in MotionA screening of new video works by Joianne Bittle, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Dylan Gauthier, Nathan Kensinger, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, and Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)Over the past two summers, the artists of Chance Ecologies have engaged with three different sites in Queens: Hunter‰Ûªs Point South, the Newtown Creek and the Flushing River. The works in this screening present a wide range of responses to these post-industrial sites, ranging from collaborative performances to solitary explorations, and employ a variety of film techniques, including stop motion animation, underwater recordings, and drone footage. Each of these films is a unique creation inspired by a different aspect of these landscapes, and when viewed together, they present a larger picture of the ideas informing Chance Ecologies. The screening will be following by a Q&A with the artists. Please click here for more information on the screenings: http://www.queensmuseum.org/2016/10/chance-ecologies-in-motion1:30‰ÛÓ2pm: Chance Ecologies on ViewGallery walk and refreshmentsThe curators of Chance Ecologies will lead a walk-through of Chance Ecologies: Queens, the current exhibit in the Queens Museum Community Partnerships Gallery, giving an overview of the ideas behind Chance Ecologies. Several artists, include Kristyna and Marek Milde, Marisa Tesauro, and Joianne Bittle, will be present to give details about their individual works. Light refreshments will be provided.2‰ÛÓ3:30pm: Creatively Engaging Chance EcologiesArtist talks by Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson WrightChance Ecologies: Queens includes a variety of creative approaches to engaging with flora and fauna found in post-industrial urban wildernesses. These artist talks will take a deeper look into three different approaches to the landscape, from walking to seed collecting to virtual reality.Coyote Walk ProjectDillon de Give will speak about the Coyote Walk Itinerancy, a short walking residency which he has been leading annually for 8 years. Originally inspired by Hal, a wild coyote that appeared in New York City in 2006, the project examines and traces greenspace channels running through NYC and surrounding wilds. This talk will begin in the Community Partnerships Gallery, move to the Panorama of New York City, and end in the Queens Museum theater.Vegetative Resistance: Weeds and Wildness in Human Dominated LandscapesEllie Irons works with cosmopolitan spontaneous plants that thrive in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. Often described as weeds, they provide a starting point for exploring nativeness, invasion, gentrification and the future of land use in the face of global climate change. As we concern ourselves with big questions of globalization, mass extinction, and climate change, we exert control in small ways by attempting to restore or cultivate landscape fragments to mimic historical ideals. As we pour resources into such measures, what are we losing, erasing, eradicating? Expanding from these questions, Irons will explore the tale of one particular weedy species: Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis), while raising questions about human and vegetative agency in the so-called Anthropocene.Hidden Vistas: Empathy and Place in Virtual Reality InstallationsWhat does it mean to have empathy for a place? How can we use cutting edge technologies such as virtual reality and 360å¡ video to immerse a viewer in places that no longer exist? That are too difficult to find? Too hazardous to visit? Edrex Fontanilla and Sarah Nelson Wright share their creative process of applying ‰ÛÏthe empathy machine‰Ûù to wild geographies.3:30‰ÛÓ4:30pm: Digging into Chance EcologiesA public discussion led by the curators of Chance Ecologies and Daniel CampoThe closing event of this daylong symposium will open up a larger conversation amongst the artists and participants of Chance Ecologies, lead by co-curators Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger and by Daniel Campo, author of ‰ÛÏThe Accidental Playground.‰Ûù This discussion will consider the underlying themes of Chance Ecologies: What is the importance of unplanned green spaces? What types of ecologies can thrive in liminal, post-industrial landscapes, and why? How can we responsibly interact with and advocate for these spaces? What is the role of artists and creativity and community in these spaces? How can chance ecological landscapes becomes sites of new relational structures between humans, the environment and other species? What will happen to these spaces in the future, as the city faces challenges caused by rising sea levels and climate change?Image by Nathan Kensinger",1,ART_EVENT

The event will cover the era of the slumlord fires, the subsequent redevelopment, as well as the most recent efforts to gentrify the Bronx via luxury developments, including an attempted renaming of the South Bronx and the art-washing that is plaguing major cities throughout the globe. Longtime tenants who survived the fires will give testimonials and veteran activists from Nos Quedamos, Mothers on the Move, and Take Back the Bronx will provide a historical context for the battle of the Bronx now raging between the community, developers, and the artists caught in between.This event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, complementing the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro‰Ûªs Nonstop Metropolis: A New York Atlas at the Queens Museum on October 2, 2016.

ART_EVENT,"Exhibition Dates: October 8-30, 2016Opening Reception & Walkthrough with Curators & Artists: October 8, 2pm-4pmParticipatory Workshops and Public Performances: October 16, 2016Chance Ecologies Symposium: October 23, 2016Chance Ecologies: Queens is an exhibit of new works, artistic gestures and research projects engaging with the undesigned and wild growing landscapes found in post-industrial sites, landfills and other liminal spaces around Queens. This exhibit brings together creative works from a large group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists, who have explored three of these sites around the borough over the past two years: Hunter‰Ûªs Point South, the Newtown Creek, and the Flushing River. Each of these places has its own unique history and landscape, but all three are united by a shared legacy of industrial pollution and human intervention.Over the centuries, the Queens waterfront has been reshaped by successive waves of development and redevelopment, creating an entirely new urban coastline. Once a series of natural ecosystems, lined with streams and rivers, wetlands and forests, the shoreline is now home to power plants, highways, landfills, and new residential and commercial developments. However, several sections of this man-made waterfront have been temporarily reclaimed by nature, hovering between waves of development and real estate speculation, and have become unplanned green spaces. These unmanaged meadows, glens and marshes support a diversity of life not found in the city‰Ûªs official parks, providing an important habitat for wild species of birds, insects, trees and flowers, and upending our assumptions of human dominance in the city.Chance Ecologies: Queens opens up the complex dialogues about the importance of these spaces by inviting artists and community members to creatively engage with them, both in the museum and in person. The artists‰Ûª of Chance Ecologies extensive, ongoing research and fieldwork explores the varieties of life found in these sites, while also articulating a deeper understanding of how the environment has been and continues to be radically reshaped by human impacts, including globalization and climate change. By bringing members of the public to these remote areas, to creatively engage with these artistic responses, Chance Ecologies celebrates the resilience of urban nature, and asks community members to consider their own place in the larger sphere of life.Chance Ecologies: Queens includes a diverse array of artworks, from video installation and new media to sculpture and drawing, the results of collaborations between archaeologists, architects, filmmakers, urbanists and naturalists with community members of all ages and backgrounds. To expand the dialogue around this exhibit, Chance Ecologies will present a day of participatory art projects and public performances along the Flushing River on October 16th, and a symposium of authors, artists, academics and community groups at the museum on October 23rd. More information on those events will be announced at the Queens Museum website.Chance Ecologies: Queens is curated by artists Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger, and includes work by many of the artists and thinkers who have been a part of Chance Ecologies, including Joianne Bittle, Daniel Campo, Laura Chipley, Nate Dorr, Maya Edelman, Edrex Fontanilla, Dylan Gauthier, Dillon de Give, Ellie Irons, Chris Kennedy, Kristyna Milde, Marek Milde, Anne Percoco, Edmund Mooney, Matthias Neumann, Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit), Raphaele Shirley, Marisa Tesauro, and Sarah Nelson Wright.Chance Ecologies was created in 2015 by Catherine Grau, Nathan Kensinger and Stephen Zacks, and has been supported by the Queens Museum, ArtBuilt Mobile Studios and the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation with a residency at the Studio In The Park program, and has worked in partnership with Amplifier Inc., RadiatorArts, and the Newtown Creek Alliance.

His social justice work began in Buffalo working with local residents and activists to organize for the clean-up of Brownfield sites in low income communities of color and creating processes based in self determination and creative visioning.Shortly after returning back to New York City in 2007, he started focusing on gentrification, environmental justice issues and looking at how creative planning principles can be used to preserve communal and cultural spaces that provide opportunities for inter-generational learning. In 2013 after working on solidarity projects in Cuba and Brazil, his commitment to developing youth leadership both locally and internationally motivated him to join The Brotherhood/Sister Sol, working until 2016, with young people to end police control in Harlem. The Brotherhood/Sister Sol is a holistic youth development organization located in West Harlem dedicated to long term development of young people of color as long term critically thinking leaders. He continues to organize and work on community based art projects as part of the Harlem Copwatch Team and is the founder of the Renaissance Chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation.The Laundromat Project (LP) amplifies the creativity that already exists within communities by using arts and culture to build community networks, solve problems, and enhance our sense of ownership in the places where we live, work, and grow. LP envisions a world in which artists are understood as valuable assets in every community and everyday people know the power of their own creative capacity to transform their lives, their relationships, and their surroundings.

ART_EVENT,"A National Convening Around the Peace TableTo accompany the exhibition Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art, the Queens Museum presents Artists In/Of The City, a special convening that explores the current wave of new artist residency programs in city agencies taking place throughout the nation.Beyond Mierle Laderman Ukeles‰Ûª almost four decade long artist residency within the NYC Department of Sanitation, NYC‰Ûªs Department of Cultural Affairs has recently initiated artist residencies inside three other city agencies and is working on more. Cities around the country, including Boston, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, are experimenting with their own versions of residencies within municipal agencies and departments.Artists In/Of The City convening provides an open space to share and discuss the aspirations and experiences of artists and their city agency partners involved in these kinds of residencies in NYC and across the country. We‰Ûªve also invited those in charge of organizing these residencies to share how they initiated and structured their residencies given their local contexts. We hope that these examples will illuminate the best ways moving forward to harness artists‰Ûª unique creative and critical contributions to how urban systems work.The Artists In/Of The City convening starts with a brief examination by Ukeles of the artworks that inspired the event from the Touch Sanitation Show, 1984. Three works originally conceived for Touch Sanitation Show have been reimagined for the Queens Museum, and we will meet in front of One Year‰Ûªs Worktime II, 1984/2016, a full year of work shifts in the form of clock faces has been silkscreened over a gradient of colors representing the seasons which is installed on the Museum‰Ûªs Large Wall in the Main Atrium. We will then assemble around the Peace Table, originally commissioned in 1997 by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for Ukeles‰Ûªs installation Unburning Freedom Hall. Made of layers of cobalt blue stained glass and plate glass in the shape of a halo, it will be suspended from 50 feet above the central atrium of the Queens Museum.This setting for the convening, a literal round table, has inspired a format for the convening consisting of three concentric rings of guests. The first ring will be Presenters, artists and city officials with direct experience with residences at municipal agencies whose presentations will act as conversation starters for the convening. The second ring will be Respondents, other artists who have been asked to prepare questions to bring to the table that can deepen the conversation. The third ring will be Participants, other invited artists and the general public interested in the theme that can keep the conversation going with their own questions and comments during the convening.Moderated by Queens Museum Director Laura Raicovich.Confirmed guests for the convening include:- Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Sanitation- Vito Turso, Deputy Commissioner of Public Information at NYC Department of Sanitation- Norman Steisel, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Brendan Sexton, Former Commissioner at NYC Department of Sanitation- Tom Finkelpearl, Commissioner of NYC Department of Cultural Affairs- Tania Bruguera, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Mayor‰Ûªs Office of Immigrant Affairs- Nisha Agarwal, NYC Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs- Latisha Russaw & Ellen Greeley, Department of Veterans' Services- Jules Rochielle, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteran‰Ûªs Services- Christine Tinsley, Artist-in-Residence at NYC Department of Veteran‰Ûªs Services- Gladys Carrion, Commissioner of NYC Administration for Children‰Ûªs Services- The Lost Collective, Artists-in-Residence at NYC Administration for Children‰Ûªs Services- Marcus Young, former City Artist, City of St Paul, MN- Alan Nakagawa, Artists-in-Residence at Los Angeles Department of Transportation- Julie Burros, Chief of Arts and Culture, City of Boston- Gulgun Kayim, Chief of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy, City of MinneapolisImage: Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Touch Sanitation Performance, 1979-1980.

ART_EVENT,"Curated by Catherine Grau and Nathan KensingerThis event is a part of a series of six programs associated with Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix, leading up to the launch of Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro‰Ûªs New York atlas Nonstop Metropolis at the Queens Museum in November 2016. Rebecca Solnit‰Ûªs essay The Oysters In The Spire is a jumping off point for the map Wildlife by cartographer Molly Roy and artist Tino Rodriguez; both found in Nonstop Metropolis. The curators of Chance Ecologies have created a daylong event inspired by this essay and map.The public is invited to join an international group of Queens and Brooklyn-based artists from Chance Ecologies at a series of participatory actions and workshops in the wilderness along the banks of the Newtown Creek, one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States. Participants will be invited to creatively engage with urban wildlife, environmental activism, and art practices exploring industrialized landscapes. Participants will interact with a diverse range of species living in and along the creek, and with unique arts projects being developed on its shoreline by Chance Ecologies, a curatorial framework for artistic practices exploring unplanned, post-industrial wild spaces.This day of activities will take place at the Plank Road project site, one of the only access points to the unplanned shoreline of the Newtown Creek, and is being presented in partnership with the Newtown Creek Alliance. Broadsides of the Rebecca Solnit essay and Wildlife map will be distributed to all attendees, courtesy of the Queens Museum.Directions:All events will begin at the intersection of 47th Street and 58th Road in Maspeth, Queens. This is a remote industrial location. Bring sturdy shoes. Water and shade will be provided. The nearest subway station is the L Train station at Grand Street, which is about a 20 minute walk (5 minute bike ride) east along Grand Avenue to 47th Street. The closest bus stop is at Grand Avenue and 47th Street on the Q59 route. Walk north on 47th Street for one block to reach the event site.Schedule of Events:Plank Road Welcome / Willis Elkins and Nathan Kensinger1 ‰ÛÒ 1:30pmChance Ecologies curator Nathan Kensinger and Newtown Creek Alliance (NCA) program manager Willis Elkins will introduce visitors to the Plank Road site, leading a walk along the shoreline. Elkins will discuss the work that the NCA is doing to create access and re-introduce species to the Newtown Creek, giving an overview of his Living Dock and Plank Road initiatives, while Kensinger will discuss how wildlife in and around the creek has inspired a variety of creative arts projects, from George Trakas‰Ûª Nature Walk to recent public arts installations like The Newtown Creek Armada and Chance Ecologies. A field guide to local birds will be distributed, for visitors to seek their own inspiration onsite.Virtual Reality, Empathy, and Place / Edrex Fontanilla1:30pm to 4pmNew media artist Edrex Fontanilla will bring individual visitors into an immersive experience of the lost wilderness of Hunter‰Ûªs Point South, allowing participants to exist in a place that no longer exists. One by one, viewers will be brought to a secluded waterfront glen and given a virtual reality mask, to experience the sights and sounds of a unique, wild landscape that once stood along the Newtown Creek.Maspeth Creek Voyage / Nathan Kensinger, Laura Chipley, Sarah Nelson Wright1:30pm-4pmPeer into a video porthole transporting you underneath the waters of the Newtown Creek and into the nearby environs of the Maspeth Creek inlet, where egrets, herons and barnacles scratch out an existence in the raw sewage of one of New York City‰Ûªs largest combined sewer overflows. This immersive video installation was originally created for The Newtown Creek Armada, a boat pond installed on the creek in 2012 at the Newtown Creek Nature Walk.Dancing With Weeds / Lise Brenner2-3pmChoreographer Lise Brenner will lead a group of participants in creating a danceable map of the vegetation along the Newtown Creek at Plank Road, connecting movement, plants and landmarks. No dance experience necessary. Wear appropriate footwear.The Wild Within / Dillon de Give3pm-7pmWalking artist Dillon de Give will organize short partnered walks bounded by mutual gaze. The Wild Within is an experiment in seeing each other, inspired by the following quote:‰ÛÏSince that day, when I close my eyes I can see the pupils of the two rust-colored coyotes. There was something secret there, a wildness that didn‰Ûªt belong to the coyote but that I recognized as my fundamental nature. It was who I was but it didn‰Ûªt belong to me. It was the intelligence of all beings. It was uncultivated, unbiased, and unconditioned. It was true intelligence.‰Ûù ‰ÛÒ Paul Rezendes, The Wild WithinImpossible Bridge / Edmund Mooney + Dylan Gauthier3pm-5pmA collaboration between artists Edmund Mooney and Dylan Gauthier, Impossible Bridge is a performance and floating sound sculpture that utilizes a hand-built boat and two hydrophones to create an underwater audio bridge to span the long-disused creek crossing at Plank Road.Seed Collecting Walk / Ellie Irons and Anne Percoco4pm and 5:30pmA walk along the wild-growing banks of the Newtown Creek, to identify and gather seeds from the hardy plants that are thriving on the banks of this super-funded waterway. Collected seeds will become part of the Next Epoch Seed Library, an art installation which provides a diverse gene pool of weedy species, well-situated to face the Anthropocene era.Undomesticated Species, Blindness & Bliss / Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit)6-7pmAs part of an ongoing film project at Plank Road, artist Natalia Roumelioti (ntilit) will arrange a sound performance by artist Tamio Shiraishi, based on the underlying script of her project. The audience is welcomed to sink into the sound and the existing environment of the Newtown Creek, as Shiraishi signals with his sound to the birds.The Wild Call / Catherine Grau7pmA participatory performance piece designed by Chance Ecologies curator Catherine Grau. As a closing ceremony for the day‰Ûªs events, all present guests will be asked to silently walk onto the site, and perform an improvised collection of bird calls, howls and other wild sounds.Curated by Catherine Grau and Nathan Kensinger",1,ART_EVENT
