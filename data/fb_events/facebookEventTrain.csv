The capoeiristas emphasize on control of their movements, quick strategy and reaction to smoothly trick each other and conquer one another‰Ûªs space.Those who form the roda clap, sing and play hand-made percussive instruments such as the berimbau, the atabaque (drum), the pandeiro (tambourine), and the agogÌ« (cowbells). Music is essential in capoeira.  The rhythm played by the berimbau determines the type of game that takes place.  The rhythm also sets the pace of the game, movements and characteristics of a given game.Songs are sung in a call and response format or in the form of narratives. Typically songs can tell stories about capoeira figures, anecdotes, tales, life deceptions or victories, humor, etc.  Often the capoeira singer uses songs to comment on the game being played at the moment, thus making the capoeira roda as spontaneous as it can be.",0,FITNESS

These studies have regarded change as a driving force, variously positive and negative, but always present. This conference will explore change as a theme and inspiration of both academic discourse and scientific exploration, from antiquity to the present day and beyond. We invite papers/posters and panel/session proposals from all disciplines focusing on works from any period that explore change as it is discussed in literature, philosophy, theory, art, film, science, or society and its effects on the study of the same. Possible topics falling under this heading include, but are not limited to: Difficulties posed by change; Persistence of identity throughout change; Varieties of change; Conditions of change; Beginning and ending; Change and the individual; Climate and environmental change; Regime change and revolution; Paradigm shifts; Gender; Race; Education; Representation; Love; Death; Scientific change; Evolutionary change; and Societal change.To submit to the conference please go to our website and follow the directions.Individual Paper Abstracts due by January 5",1,LECTURE

The three-stage CrossFit Games season acts as a funnel, starting with the all-inclusive online Open, advancing to the selective live regionals, and concluding with an elite few on a world stage at the CrossFit Games.The 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games East Regional features the fittest men, women, and teams from the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. 41,000 athletes from these two regions entered the Open, but only the top-40 men, 40 women, and 30 6-person teams were invited to compete at the East Regional (May 27-29).Over the course of the three-day weekend, the athletes will face a barrage of tests designed to reveal any flaws in their fitness. Can they do well in long events? Short events? Heavy lifting? Gymnastics? To make it to the Games, these athletes must be true generalists capable of handling any task thrown at them.The five men, five women, and five teams who do the best in relation to their peers across all of the events will be invited to compete at the CrossFit Games held at the StubHub Center in Carson, California July 19-24.The East Regional will be held at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.Regional tickets cost $75 for three days of access, or $30 per day.Kids 12 and under are admitted free of charge with a ticketed adult.Each affiliate owner (Licensee of Record) will receive a complimentary three-day ticket to their local regional.

SPORTS_EVENT,"Registration for the Open begins Jan. 14, 2016.More than 272,000 people from around the globe competed in the Open last year. As the largest CrossFit community event of the season, the Open ties together athletes from within the same gym to those in their broader city, country and world.For five weeks, you‰ÛÓand the hundreds of thousands of other people who signed up‰ÛÓare at the whim of the Director of the Games Dave Castro, taking on workouts that may push you to learn a new skill, improve the skills you already have or go into a darker place than you‰Ûªve ever been before.The Open welcomes anyone 14 to 100 years old. (We‰Ûªll take any centenarians, too.) All you need to do is sign up, and enter a score each week. You can complete the workouts at a participating CrossFit affiliate in front of a judge, or film your performance from anywhere you want and submit a link as proof.To make the Open even more accessible, we introduced a scaled option in 2015. Each time a workout is released, athletes will be given two versions: Rx‰Ûªd and Scaled. The Scaled-workout option is designed to be accessible to the majority of people who attend CrossFit affiliates. If you do CrossFit, there‰Ûªs a very high chance you can do the Open, too.Workouts are released each week on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT, and athletes have four days or 96 hours to complete the workout and submit their score. Scores are due before 5 p.m. PT that Monday.Five Weeks | Feb. 25 - March 28, 201616.1: Feb. 25 - 2916.2: March 3 - 716.3: March 10 - 1416.4 March 17 - 2116.5 March 24 - 28The fittest athletes will advance to the next stage of the season.More: http://games.crossfit.com/about-the-games/the-open",0,SPORTS_EVENT

MEETUP,"Sound surrounds us constantly.  Yet, it is not often that we can integrate the sounds around us into our self-care and healing processes.  However, sound rendered and received with the intention of healing opens our awareness and our bodies to the profound effects of vibration.  It is astonishing what a difference can be made in one's physical well-being, state of mind, and quality of life with the regular exposure to even just a few simple sound healing techniques. Drawing from ancient meditative practices of Tibet and India, elements of indigenous shamanic traditions, as well as contemporary methods, this event offers a centering and revitalizing experience of sound to support optimal states of physical wellness, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  By experiencing various instruments (including singing bowls, flutes, tuning forks, percussion instruments, chimes, and more) as well as exercising their own voices, participants explore fundamental principles of sound healing and learn how implementing these principles can have a positive impact on their holistic well-being.  90 Minutes.  $30 per person",0,MEETUP

The closest subway is the Q to Prospect Park, but you can also walk from the F to 15th St. or the 2/3 to Grand Army Plaza. Of course we are sad to leave our longtime Sunday home at Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is turning our patch of pavement into beautiful new parkland next year.

If anyone knows me they would know  that I am no Democrat!! But When Domenic Says he is going to do something he follows through and does not stop until the job is done. If I didn't know Domenic the way I do I would probably be voting for Michael Grimm too. While he was Councilman he did these events in the restaurant called THE SENIOR PROMS- He invited all the Senior Citizen in the Synagogues, Churches & Nursing Homes in his district and hired a live Band so the elderly could have a night out. THEY LOVED IT!!! and When we were hit by Hurricane Sandy Domenic used whatever contacts he had to get the Red Cross and Fema set up in MCU parking lot within two days. He begged me to open Gargiulos Restaurant  so we could arrange feeding the people of Coney Island Thanksgiving Dinner, When it was impossible for me to accommodate it. He hired buses to transport the people to and From the El Caribe. I feel the reason he is having a difficult time is because he cares more about the people and less about the politicians.I can honestly Support Domenic and I know that if he wins He will get the right people in place to get the job done. and we will truly have a partner in Government to bring the resource that we so desperately need.                   VOTE FOR Domenic Recchia",1,FAMILY_EVENT
